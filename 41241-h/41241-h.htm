<h2>PREFACE<br />

<span class="lin2">TO THE FIRST EDITION.</span></h2>


<p>No product finds so many and ample applications
as color. Nearly every trade requires it for
the decoration of its products so as to adapt them
more generally and pleasantly to the present
demands.</p>

<p>The art of marbling is that branch of our trade,
in which color is brought into use for the decoration
of bindings, yet it has not found the desirable
general introduction into our book-binderies because
practical men have not so intently employed
their time and endeavors, to overcome the
difficulties, which resist its general application.</p>

<p>Who could solve easier and more correctly than
the mechanics, to whom these difficulties and
obstacles offer themselves in practice? He is the
only one to find the remedy, scientific men not
possessing sufficient technical knowledge. Only
he is ready and able to stand up for such special
trades, to work and to fight for them, who is himself
interested and who not only learned to
understand the art of marbling from former
instructions and traditions, but from his own
practical experience.</p>

<p>To him only, will it be possible to gain by close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
study true points, on which to further develop
the whole subject.</p>

<p>My original plan was, not only to remove the
technical difficulties of the art of marbling, but
also to ascertain the correct colors from the mass
at present manufactured, for the purpose of
manufacturing marbling colors.</p>

<p>But in this I did not succeed as easily as I expected.
Every color manufactory possesses
another system to produce its products, and after
thousands of experiments I was finally forced to
resort to chemistry for the purpose of gaining a
knowledge of the raw products viz: earths, metals,
acids, bases and their conditions and qualities in
order to study their compositions and precipitations,
the coloring composite of lake colors and
their bodies, and to subject them to investigation
on their effects on marbling size.</p>

<p>This was a tiresome work which demanded much
patience and pertinacity. During these investigations,
I have learned to know the influence of
sizing upon colors and how it hindered or
expedited a beautiful marbling or comb edging.</p>

<p>Through these experiments I unexpectedly gained
a certain knowledge which enabled me to
overcome the technical difficulties of the marbling
art. The greater the difficulties the more they
aroused my zeal to surmount them and the greater
my joy when victory was won. During my
investigations I saw, that not the color itself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
its body, to which the color is bound either in a
natural or chemical way, forms the important part
of the colors necessary to our purpose. No branch
puts so many critical demands upon the preparation
of colors as the art of marbling, because, aside
from the most careful grating which can only be
done by using the best of painter's colors, there
must be a great power of divisibility and excellent
covering qualities so that the pigments do not turn
pale by the propelling power of the ox-gall
expanding on the size, but retain in a dry state,
their full lustre. It is therefore impossible without
a more thorough knowledge of the chemistry of
colors to find from the legion of colors, which are
thrown upon the market, the ones best adapted to
our art. So much more so as, in most recent
times, by simplification in the manufacture of
most colors their quality, for marbling, has most
essentially deteriorated.</p>

<p>Colors which are used for painting, lithography
and printing with the greatest success may be
entirely unfit for marbling. The cause is not to
be found in their preparation for our purposes, but
in the manufacture itself, as the qualities, which
are indispensable are not known.</p>

<p>The main attention in the manufacture is directed
to the finding of colors free from poison and
which will not fade, when exposed to light, if they
are intended for a wholesale consumption in
painting and the graphical art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>All colors which we intend to use for marbling
purposes must have body, because bodiless colors
become mixed with the size and run off from the
paper in marbling, they therefore can be designated
as useless for our purpose. The most important
composite parts of colors for marbling are certain
substances, among which hydrates of argillaceous
earths, tin and lead oxides and sulphate of barium
are named as the best.</p>

<p>A great number of coloring matters of organic
origin, which are soluble in water, have the
propensity in mixing with a solution of salts of
lead, tin, and argillaceous earths, with a metallic
oxide to form a compound which is soluble with
difficulty (and is termed insoluble,) when the
latter is precipitated from the solution by an alkali.
The precipitations which are obtained in this way
are known as lake dyes. Of greater importance
for the quality of the marbling colors are the
physical conditions of these precipitates, they are
either crystallized or amorphous, the former not
possessing any value to us.</p>

<p>The serviceable, i. e. the amorphous precipitates,
by their quality of great divisibility give excellent
colors.</p>

<p>Among the great number of numeral colors
there are many which in spite of their amorphous
properties are bad marbling colors, such as the
compounds of copper, zinc and arsenic. Often it depends
upon the manner of manufacturing, even if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
color have a good body whether it can be used by
us, as, for instance, white lead and barium both of
which can be produced as good or useless colors.</p>

<p>The general idea, that light colors are the best,
is erroneous, even heavy oxides of metal being
excellent colors. Not in weight but in divisibility
rests the excellence, for instance I mention pure
oxide of iron, cadmium, sulphate of mercury
and mercury iodide. These are all heavy metallic
oxides and good colors.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the colors the different ways of
sizing are most essential parts of marbling. They
exercise a great influence on the success of beautiful
edges and for that reason I directed my closest
attention to them. The more homogeneous and the
smaller the viscosity of the mucilage of the sizing,
the better for comb, peacock and bouquet edging.</p>

<p>Marbled and veined edges demand more
viscosity of the mucilage, which, if the sizing does
not possess it, is usually formed during the first
stage of decomposition, when the normal time for
using it for comb edges has passed. I will mention
further on the ox-gall and the sprinkling water,
which are indispensable on account of their binding
and expanding powers for the purposes of
marbling.</p>

<p>It is an easy manipulation to prepare ox-gall,
so that it does not decompose, but on the other
hand a much greater attention must be paid to the
binding and expanding powers of the same, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they may have, in spite of its excellent qualities
for color, by insufficient caution in their handling
the most deleterious influences on the colors as
well, as on the sizing and in most cases are the
causes of the failure of the edging. There are
several substances, which possess qualities similar
to ox-gall and many others which possess only its
expansibility.</p>

<p>To the former belong resins which are insoluble
but which can be dissolved by the addition of
ammonia or borax, to the latter fatty acids of alkali,
which we know by the name of soaps and which I
shall describe in the article on ox-gall.</p>

<p>Sprinkling-water is mostly used on account of
its greater expansibility and its propensity to
form circular spots on the marbling ground,
(sizing) for veined edges, or as an addition to the
ground color of the marble edge. Although it
does not possess the binding power of ox-gall for
colors in such a degree, it is nevertheless, worthy
of our attention. It was the aim of my investigations
during many years to bring this all into a
harmonious ensemble, and produce a fine and
paying work.</p>

<p>In composing this book, I have aimed to arrange
it in such a way, that it will be a guide not only to
the uninitiated, but also to the practical mechanic.
For this reason the book will only give such
methods of the marbling as will be crowned with
sure success and which have given me satisfactory
results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>As books, which are intended for practical men,
can only obtain an intrinsic value by combination
of facts, gained by practical experience, with
scientific principles, I have attempted to attain this
object and I hope to have created a lasting work of
our trade-literature.</p>

<span class="lin2">TO THE SECOND EDITION.</span></h2>


<p>It is a pleasure and a satisfaction to every author
to write the preface to the second edition of his
work, as the sale of the first proves sufficiently,
that it has found recognition and commendation.</p>

<p>In the second edition, I have given the results
of my uninterrupted studies and the new observations
I have made during the last five years. It is
my hope not only, that I shall make the study
easier to the inexperienced, but also to offer to the
experienced marbler a practical compendium in
cases of frequently arising difficulties.</p>

<p>The publisher of this new edition has added to
it a number of samples, which were collected
under my supervision and which certainly will be
highly welcome.</p>

<p>I hope and wish that the new edition with its
practical arrangement, with its description of my
newest observations and with its tables of samples
and the other additions and improvements, will find
the approval of the trade and will increase the
number of friends and patrons of the marbling art.</p>

<h2><a name="HISTORICAL" id="HISTORICAL"></a>HISTORICAL.</h2>


<p>Every branch of industrial art possesses its
champions and originators, who have employed
their whole intellectual and physical powers to
solve problems for the purpose of enhancing and
furthering their material welfare.</p>

<p>Often from small beginnings, within a longer or
shorter period of time, great enterprises spring into
existence, which greatly further our development
in culture, science and arts, and are blessings to
the whole civilized world. The material welfare
arising from them renders it necessary that new
champions continuously enter the arena and
combat in the cause of progressive industry.</p>

<p>The industries of color and paper making which
play most important parts in the art of marbling
shall be the first subjects of my essay.</p>

<p>The paper industry which is very highly developed
will have a much better future on account of
its possibilities in the line of improvement.
To-day, in the iron-age, we speak of a paper-age,
and for good reasons, because there hardly passes
a year which does not bring new discoveries,
showing the extraordinary adaptability of paper.
One branch of the paper industry which to-day is
considered as an especial part of the industry is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the manufacture of colored paper, the origin of
which, as far as our literature is able to state,
extends as far back as the first part of the last
century.</p>

<p>From it springs the art of marbling, which in
latter years was introduced into our trade.</p>

<p>The manufacture of colored paper makes a
second branch of industry indispensable and one
which stands on as high a stage of development as
the paper industry; this is the manufacture of
colors, which deserve the greatest attention on our
part on account of the marbling art.</p>

<p>There is hardly a second branch of chemistry
which is of such a great old age, historically
proven, as the color industry.</p>

<p>We hardly know of a nation on the whole
globe which does not make use of color in some
way. The use of color for the purpose of embellishment
and adornment dates back to historical times.
Nature itself, by the beauty of the colors of her
flowers and minerals acted as a teacher in the
artistic development of the human race.</p>

<p>Egyptian wall paintings show richly developed
forms and figures adorned with multi-colored
fabrics.</p>

<p>This is a proof that the Egyptians not only
understood the art of the manufacture of colors but
that they also knew the much higher art of
fastening the color on textile fabrics, i. e., the art
of dyeing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In olden times for the coloring of objects,
mineral colors which occur in nature the result of
a decomposition of metals and earths and had only
to be put through a sieve and washed to adapt
them to the painters use, were exclusively used.</p>

<p>To alchemy, which was the origin of Chemistry
of to-day, we owe a surprisingly large number of
artificial mineral colors, for the reason that with
predilection it brought metals, earths and mineral
compounds within the sphere of its researches
which were aimed at the production of gold, but
which all were ineffective in this direction. But
the time and labor, which were employed in these
investigations, were not thrown away. By alchemy
an immense number of chemical compounds became
known, without which knowledge the
chemistry of to-day would not have reached its
exalted stage of perfection.</p>

<p>Exclusive of mineral colors several organic
colors came into use, the most being applied in
the dyeing establishments as they were bodiless
colors and at that time the art of binding them to
metallic oxides was unknown.</p>

<p>By and by it became known in what way to
bind the coloring matter of plants to bodies and to
make them serviceable in the art of painting and
the graphic arts. Since that time progress in this
field has been so rapid that we gaze in astonishment
upon the achievements of the color chemistry
of to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The progress which developed industrial art and
caused it to flourish, was enhanced by a new and
highly important invention, the industry of tar
colors.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how man through the vigor of
his intellect, tears from nature her hidden treasures
which have lain in obscurity for thousands and
thousands of years.</p>

<p>Who would have thought, that the antediluvian
vegetation with its splendor of thousands
of colors should celebrate its resurrection in
aniline colors which by their splendid qualities of
richness and intensity over-shadowed everything
before them? It is a pity that we are only able to
use these colors in limited numbers in our trade.</p>

<p>Up to this time they are used more for dyeing
purposes, because they are without body and
possess two apparently insurmountable proclivities,
1st, they do not mix so intimately with oxides of
metal as the organic coloring stuffs of plants and
they cannot for a long period withstand the
influence of light.</p>

<p>In the meantime it is to be hoped with confidence,
that science will soon find the solution for these
difficulties. Already the forerunners of body
colors have been discovered, a few which could withstand
light have followed, as geranium lake in
which the coloring matter is only bound to oxide of
lead by surface adhesion. Furthermore scarlet
lake, which, although bound to oxide of lead, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
been put in such a state that it does not run and
lastly the artificial krapp-(madder) lake and indigo,
which have been produced from coal-tar and nearly
equal to the good color lakes of the animal and
floral kingdoms.</p>

<p>The main attention in the production of these
colors is directed to the end of finding those which
are free of poison and will not fade, to make them
serviceable to the historic art of painting.</p>

<p>For the aniline color there is therefore a wide
field open to experiment.</p>

<p>Whether our interests and demands in regard to
colors will be fulfilled is a question of time.</p>

<p>Even the newer productions of the animal and
vegetable kingdom already differ in quality from
those indispensable to the art of marbling.</p>

<p>I recommend to my honored colleagues to read
my book with attention, so that the intended gain
shall not be missed and the beautiful art of marbling
may attain a larger circle of friends.</p>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="THE_SIZE" id="THE_SIZE"></a>THE SIZE.</h2>


<p>The first process in marbling is the preparation
of <span class="smcap">the size</span> on which the colors are to be floated.</p>

<p>By the name of size is meant a consistent
glutinous mass, which is obtained by boiling or
dissolving with water certain bodies derived from
the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>Mucilage is found in many plants, especially in
the outer skin of seeds, also in many roots, barks,
stems and leaves, but its solubility and consistency
are very much varied.</p>

<p>Generally the mucilage of plants is classed
among the gums; but there is a large difference
from them in this, that it will not give a perfect,
diaphanous and homogeneous solution, but only
swells in it to a thick, massy and viscous fluid,
which is similar to starch paste. It is composed of
small quantities of gum, starch, sugar and consistent
plant-mucilage. If prepared from certain
plants, for example the algae of the sea, it also
contains small quantities of iodine.</p>

<p>Starch swells in hot water, while with mucilage
the same result is achieved by using cold water.</p>

<p>Smaller quantities of mucilage are found in
every plant, but larger in gum tragacanth, carrageen
or Iceland moss, salep, the leaves of mallows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or of colts foot or tussilage, the roots of marsh
mallow, seeds of plantago-psyllium, (flea-bane)
linseed and quinces.</p>

<p>Of this number but few are of interest to us,
which I shall mention further on.</p>

<p>The density and proper consistency of the size
depends on the bodies, from which the viscous or
glutinous substance is derived and also from the
quantity of water, in which it is dissolved. The
consistency of the size is also materially influenced
by the temperature, the warmer, the less substantial
and the more pliable; the colder, the more consistent
and stiff it is.</p>

<p>A good marbling size should be an entirely
homogeneous mucilage, i. e., a solution, which
should be free of any vestiges of seeds or
strings undissolved. A less viscous size is more
adapted to the production of comb-edges, while a
more viscous size to the production of marbled or
veined edges. The consistency of the mucilage of
every kind of size will soon experience an essential
change, which becomes apparent by the fact, that
the size becomes less consistent, until finally an
acid reacting fluid remains, which has no more
value for marbling purposes.</p>

<p>This chemical process is produced by the transformation
of the sugar parts of the dissolved starch
contained in the size into acid and lactic-acid.
The more starch and sugar that is contained in the
size, the sooner the acid will be generated, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
pure plant mucilage containing but little sugar and
starch will resist much longer disintegration.</p>

<p>All plant-mucilages, which are soluble in cold
water, i. e., swell, will keep much longer than
those dissolved in boiling water, because the soluble
parts remain inclosed in one cell which is only
broken by the boiling heat or by the formation of
acid. This is the reason why they only swell up
in cold solution.</p>

<p>A homogeneous mucilage will serve for
marbling much better, than that, which is produced
by swelling, because the latter has an injurious
influence on the fine distribution of color for
veined, comb and other edges. Although the
surface of such a size seems to be smooth, the eye
will discover on closer investigation the undissolved
bodies in the small granules of the size.</p>

<p>The mucilages obtained by swelling are always
milky-cloudy and never permit the colors distributed
upon them to expand with the same purity
and smoothness as the homogeneous varieties, on
account of the small granules hindering the
drawing of the colors on their surface. On the
other hand there are varieties of size, which are very
viscous on account of a too homogeneous mucilage
and therefore from their nature are not adaptable
to any kinds of edging which must be drawn by the
stylus. The colors can simply not be drawn on
the surface, because this very viscous mucilage is
drawn along by the stylus instead of being cut by it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In investigating the different varieties of size I
have noticed a very surprising action of the
extremely viscous mucilage, which nearly confused
me for the moment. I have scalded with boiling
water plantago-psyllium (flea-bane) and have
beaten it with wicker-rods tied together so as
to produce in a better manner, the mucilage found
on the outside of the seed. After cooling it off, I
filtered it through a linen cloth and poured it into
the trough but have not waited till the very viscous
thread of mucilage parted after the trough was filled
to a certain height, but have placed the vessel on the
floor and to my utter surprise the thread of the
size spread out and reached the vessel on the floor,
becoming gradually thicker until finally the
whole size flowed in a white stream with great
velocity over the rim of the trough (2 inches high)
and returned to the vessel standing on the floor
until the trough emptied. This was done in a very
short time. The cause of my surprise was in the
very consistent mucilage which took along ever-increasing
quantities of the size and finally
entirely emptied the trough.</p>

<p>Prepared colors, which on a less viscous size are
normally distributed expand with a greater velocity
to a greater extent on a more viscous size and
therefore become pale.</p>

<p>For such kinds of sizes the earth colors are
preferable but only for marbled edges.</p>

<p>The normal strength of size can be discerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
without araometer or other recommended apparatus.
My opinion is that 2/5 of an ounce of good carrageen
moss to a quart of water are sufficient, as carrageen
excels all other glutinous bodies by the quantity
of mucilage contained in it. To test the correct
strength of the size pour some of it into a flat
vessel, as a plate or dish, and throw a drop of color
upon it; if the color does not spread out, but rather
sinks down a drop of ox-gall must be added.
Renew the test and so on until the color spreads
out to about 2 inches, then take the stylus and
draw the color into lines as in producing comb-edges.
If the size be too thick the color will be
drawn along by the stylus and cannot be cut clean
through. On the other hand if the size be too thin
it can be seen immediately in its quivering and
the running of the color, which cannot be drawn
into straight lines. In the former case some clean
water must be added to the size, in the latter case
which, if the size be well boiled, seldom occurs,
thick size must be added by boiling more. The
real consistency of the size is so easily learned in
practice that a mere feeling with the fingers will be
sufficient.</p>

<p>The preparation of the colors is carried on separately
on a small part of the size, so that the whole
quantity is not rendered useless. If the colors are
rightly prepared in proportion to their expansibilities
in relation to each other, the new size is
to be poured into the trough and the marbling
may begin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The mistake which is commonly made in
marbling is, that too little attention is paid to the
size and color. Frequently the size is soiled and
the colors are spoiled by adding too much gall
before an edge is produced. For this there are
generally three causes, either the size is too fresh,
too thick or the colors have been prepared on the
same size by which the edges are to be produced.</p>

<p>Each size which is boiled should only be taken
into use after perfect cooling and after several
hours have elapsed, since in a warm state it would
not permit the colors to expand even by adding a
large quantity of gall. Only after the expiration
of ten or twelve hours after boiling will it have the
correct quantity of mucilage and then only the
size possesses its full value. This time having
elapsed, the size is filtered through a cloth and is
then ready for use.</p>

<p>A size when too thick, allows the colors to expand
only with great difficulty and demands a three fold
larger quantity of gall than when it possesses its
normal consistency. It is very difficult to remove
from a too consistent size the remnants of colors.</p>

<p>They always unite with the size and in this
way the size not only becomes soiled but it is
impregnated with a large quantity of gall. As I
said before, the colors should always be prepared
on a separate size which can be poured into a flat
vessel as it is nearly impossible to prevent several
drops of color sinking to the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>If this precaution be taken and if the colors are
prepared according to their relative expansibilities
as they are used in the order prescribed, the
process will not meet with any obstruction or
difficulty. As the size plays such an important
part in marbling, great attention must be paid to
its preparation if it is desired to make a good base
for the colors. I especially recommend to laymen
that they direct their attention to the consistency
of the size, as this is always the key to the production
of good edges.</p>

<p>The different peculiarities of the varieties of
sizes, viz; evaporation, influence of temperature,
starry formation of colors, formation of angular
scales in comb-edges, and all other things which
have influence on colors, will be treated of in a
special article on the varieties of size.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chpg" title="">CARRAGEEN MOSS.</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="CARRAGEEN_MOSS" id="CARRAGEEN_MOSS"></a>CARRAGEEN MOSS.</h2>


<p>The Carrageen or Iceland moss, or lichen is one
of the algae of the sea. Chondrus Crispus grows
on the cliffs of the Atlantic Ocean and the North
Sea. Carrageen smells slightly of iodine and when
uncleaned tastes offensively salty. Like all seaweeds
it contains a great quantity of mucilage and
small quantities of salts of iodine and bromine.
When washed in sweetened water it becomes
nearly tasteless and is without smell. On account
of the great quantity of mucilage contained in it,
and of its action as an alleviative to pulmonary
complaints it has found many applications in
medicinal practice and is given to the patient boiled
in water, milk or bouillon or as gelatine in cases of
coughs and diarrhoea, being a slightly nutritious
substance.</p>

<p>The carrageen moss or Iceland moss or weed is
a lichen and consists of a tuft of flat deeply divided
cartilaginous fronds of an olive brown, sometimes
yellowish or reddish white color; the tuft is sometimes
2 to 5 inches long.</p>

<p>The moss is used in many ways; as size for
marbling edges, for clarifying beer, as linen-weavers
starch, for finishing cloth and in the production of
iodine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The good pure carrageen is horn-like, yellowish-white,
contains a great quantity of mucilage and
gives the best size for marbling, as it complies with
all the requirements of a good size. It is homogeneous,
of great consistency, not extraordinarily viscous
and cheaper than all the other materials containing
mucilage which are used for marbling, but is
inferior to gum tragacanth as far as durability is
concerned, and that it must be subjected to
boiling, but this trouble is amply repaid by the
beauty of the productions.</p>

<p>On this size all varieties of edges can be
produced, and by its diaphanous watery mucilage
it gives an excellent ground to work upon.</p>

<p>The preparation of carrageen size is confined to
one ever recurring manipulation, which must be
repeated every eight days, if an always good and
useful size is desired; the expenses are very trifling,
a few cents for the best kind of carrageen. If
bought in larger quantities the expenses for
carrageen can still be reduced. For the preparation
of the size take a new pot, which must
always be used for this purpose exclusively, pour
in six quarts of water, which quantity is sufficient
to twice or three times fill the usual marbling
trough, add 2-1/2 ounces of Carrageen moss and boil
until the water bubbles up several times. A
longer boiling is injurious because the mucilage
becomes flaky and muddy. 2/5 of an ounce of Carrageen
to one quart of water is fully sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
produce a consistent size, provided that only the
best Carrageen is used.</p>

<p>Soft water or rain water was formerly used
exclusively for preparing the size, as by using it a
greater durability was obtained.</p>

<p>During my researches, regarding the durability
of the varieties of sizes, I found means by which
the influence of hard water on the ground can be
suspended, so that spring and pump water can now
be used without any danger.</p>

<p>Every kind of hard water contains mineral
salts, spring water especially containing lime in
smaller or larger quantities. This can be seen,
when the soap, which is used in such water,
curdles, because of the ingredients of soap stearine
palmitic or fatty acids of sodium or potassium, form
a combination with the lime, to carbonate of
lime, and the potash soap is converted into an
insoluble lime soap. If we add to hard water a
quantity of sodium or potassium, the carbonate of
lime is precipitated as a white or yellowish powder,
according to the quantity of iron contained in the
water, and a soft water remains.</p>

<p>The sun produces on a great scale in nature,
what the chemist achieves on a smaller scale by
evaporation or precipitation and cooling of steam, a
water free of all mineral salts, which we call
distilled water. Rain water is the same, but the
flowing water derived from a river already contains
mineral salts in greater or smaller quantities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which are brought into it by different springs and
substances. The water gained by precipitations
is considered soft. Carbonates of sodium or potassium
are strong bases, exactly the opposite of acids,
and they therefore prohibit the oxidation in plant
mucilages. This chemical reaction against the
formation of acids I used for the purpose of
prohibiting a deterioration of the size by adding
sodium, in which I was thoroughly successful, as it
can easily be preserved in a cool place for even
eight or ten days.</p>

<p>Two obstacles offered themselves, which I have
overcome after a tireless and thorough investigation,
first the strongly alkaline property of the size
which was generated by the added carbonate of
sodium and second the fermentation of lactic acid
which occurred notwithstanding the sodium and
made the size useless.</p>

<p>The presence of alkalies was injurious to such
colors, chemically bound to bodies, among which
red is most affected. The coloring matter was
removed from the bodies and became mixed by
running with the size, causing the size to become
soiled. Even the shade of the color was changed
to another which was nearer to purple, and in this
way, the beauty of the color was greatly lessened.
The second obstacle is the fermentation of lactic
acids which always occurs where starch flour is in
the solution, causing in consistent sizes a gradual
thinning out and even a destruction of the size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not my aim to save the size from
destruction forever, as this is impossible (laws of
nature cannot be obliterated at will) but to keep it
useful for a certain period of time, and this I
achieved after many experiments by using borax.</p>

<p>Borax is a neutral salt of strongly antiseptic
properties, prohibiting fermentation and decomposition
where neither base nor acid predominate.
Borax is produced by neutralization of boracic acid
with carbonate of sodium and can be bought at
every drug-store.</p>

<p>This salt is sold in crystals of the size of walnuts;
for our purpose it is ground to powder and is kept
for use in a closed vessel. The size is first used
without any addition of borax as it is then better
adapted for producing comb and other drawn edges,
and only after some time has elapsed, in summer
36, in winter 48 hours, are 150 grains of borax
added to the size, whereupon the size, having been
repeatedly stirred to dissolve the salt, will keep
entirely good and useful for a period of eight days
without doing any harm to the colors. On a size
which contains borax, the colors expand in a much
greater degree than upon unadulterated size, without
impairing the consistency of the mucilage. An
unadulterated size is therefore, better for marbled
and veined edges, but if it be desired to produce
only marbled and veined edges on the size, it is
advisable to add borax to the water before boiling
the carrageen moss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>As the influence of temperature is important in
marbling, and the production of beautiful edges is
often jeopardized by it, it should therefore have
the most careful attention. Every glutinous mass
acquires, according to the difference of the temperature
of the size and air, in one-half to one-quarter
of a minute, a film (top) which forms through
natural evaporation.</p>

<p>On a size which has such a film, or top, the colors
do not spread out in such circular forms as on a
size on which the colors are quickly thrown
right after the film (top) has been taken off, but
form star-like veined spots which are torn by the
film in all directions.</p>

<p>Even in the normal expansion of the drops of
color, it often happens, that the rim of the drop is
jagged, the cause being that the size already
possessed a thin top, which was not yet sufficient to
prevent the expanding of the colors. If the size be
left standing for a half-hour or an hour before
throwing on the color without having at first
removed the top of the size, the drop will tear a
hole into this film and will sink, even if quite a
large quantity of gall had been added. This
explains the contraction and the sinking down of
colors on a still warm size, inasmuch as the top is
formed by evaporation of the warm mucilage, so
quickly and so thick, that the color which had
already begun to spread out is pressed together by
it and is forced to sink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The greater the difference of temperature between
the size and air, the quicker is the top formed. It
is therefore a rule, that the size should be allowed
to cool off in the same room, in which the marbling
occurs, because in this way a symmetrical degree of
heat or cold of the size and air will be gained. On
such a size, the formation of the top is much slower
and thinner, so that even after one to one and a half
minutes after removal of the top of the size, the
colors can be thrown on without the occurrence of
the starry formation.</p>

<p>I will here mention a fact to show the importance
of temperature. As this point has given me much
trouble and has taken much time and labor, it was
my aim to find that mysterious effect which I was
unable to overcome despite my numerous chemical
experiments, until my eyes became opened and I
saw accidentally that this obstacle was the difference
of temperature of size and air. From that time on
I was able to prosecute my labors without the
slightest difficulty.</p>

<p>To show the excellence of my marbling colors,
I used a great number of samples, perhaps several
thousand, and in order to produce them I worked
on Sunday so that I could employ my whole time
to the good purpose. It was winter; on every
Saturday I ordered two pots of size to be boiled,
and to cool them off I placed them in a room, in
which there was no heat. On Sunday morning I
filtered the size through a loose linen cloth; it was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
clear as crystal, it possessed the necessary consistency,
and I was much pleased with the results,
which I had expected to achieve.</p>

<p>I commenced the preparation of the colors in a
separate flat vessel, using but little size, so as to
keep the rest from being soiled, but I was greatly
astonished, when the colors in spite of the addition
of gall, which of course was carefully done by
drops, first spread out and then again were contracted,
the starry formation of the colors took place,
whenever I was not quick enough after the taking
off of the top to throw on the colors.</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded and could give no explanation
for it; the size was sufficiently cooled off, it had
been standing the proper length of time, the
mucilage was excellent but in spite of all that,
these difficulties occurred.</p>

<p>Thinking that I might be more successful, if I
should do the marbling in the trough where there
is more surface offered to the color to spread out,
I filled the trough with size of a sufficient height
and then commenced the marbling, but immediately
after the first trial I instantly recognized that
even here my experiments would have the same
result. Although I threw on the color with great
alacrity, right after the top had been taken off, the
first drop spread out normally 4 inches, the second
but three, the third two, and the fifth and sixth
only one inch. In this way I received instead of
an equally wide band of thrown on color, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which tapered to a point. If I had not worked
according to the system which I shall describe in
the chapter of throwing on of colors, I would have
received already with the fourth drop, a star-like
formation.</p>

<p>Whatever I did to avoid this obstacle was worthless,
it was and remained a mystery and I was
unable on that day to produce anything beautiful
or worthy of consideration. This happened several
times until, by accident, and through careful study
I found the cause which was nothing but the fact,
that the size was much colder than the air in the
room in which I worked. The evaporation on the
surface of the size was so great, that the top was
formed nearly as quick as on warm size and
therefore a favorable result was impossible.</p>

<p>Another abnormity which arises from cold temperature
acting on the size is the fig-like
formation occurring during the drawing of the
colors. The cold in some way seasons the surface;
this surface becomes mixed in filtering with the
liquid part of the size in numberless small particles
which although the size is well stirred up in the
trough by the fingers, are not dissolved and this
hinders the drawing of the colors.</p>

<p>They adhere to the stylus and follow it and
arrange themselves between the color lines in a
way similar to a green fig, having a broad upper
and a pointed lower end. Such an edge traversed
by the comb will give an ugly result. A difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of temperature of the size and the air can also
occur when the working room is suddenly heated,
or, when in summer time, the size is kept in a cold
cellar. To effectively obviate this difficulty it is
necessary to bring the temperatures of the air and
size carefully to the same height which is made
easy by leaving the size, after boiling, in the room,
where the marbling is executed.</p>

<p>In winter, when the room is heated, the size
should be poured into the trough one hour before
using, in summer the thing regulates itself because
it is then unnecessary to keep the size in a cool
place, the addition of borax being a sufficient
protection against spoiling. But in spite of it all,
in winter-time when in drawing the colors the
fig-like formation should occur, it is advisable to
return the size to the pot and to warm it up
slightly so that the seasoned particles are dissolved,
until an equal temperature is reached, whereupon
after the lapse of one hour the marbling can again
be proceeded with.</p>

<p>Should the size be too thick the trouble can be
remedied by the addition of some warm water.</p>

<p>The quantity of mucilage contained in carrageen
moss varies greatly, and the consistency of the
size often depends upon the quality of the moss.
The quantity which I gave as essential to the
preparation of the size means first class moss.</p>

<p>Should the consistency of the size be insufficient
after the first trial then from 1/2 to 1 ounce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
moss should be added as it is clear that the
carrageen moss is not of prime quality. Before I
speak of another variety of size, I will repeat the
main condition which should meet with the
attention of every layman and which are as follows;
the size must not boil too long, in order that it
may not become flaky and muddy, it should
remain for cooling in the same room in which the
marbling is carried on, so that the temperature of
of it and the air are the same; the colors should be
prepared separately on a small quantity of size so
that the whole size cannot become soiled and,
lastly, the top of the size should be taken off before
the colors are thrown on, so that no film can form
before the colors cover the surface of the size.</p>

<p>The quicker the manipulation of marbling is
executed the prettier are the edges produced. As
soon as the size is covered with color, the formation
of the film is prevented.</p>

<p>As the size is one of the most important parts in
the process of marbling, I recommend these main
points to the special consideration of the reader.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GUM_TRAGACANTH" id="GUM_TRAGACANTH"></a>GUM TRAGACANTH.</h2>


<p>Gum tragacanth, also called gum-dragon, is
the product of various species of astragalus which
is found in Greece and Turkey and is a natural
exudation of shrubs and from exudations
resulting from incisions made in the stem near the
root. This shrub is from 28 to 35 inches high and
two inches in diameter. It is collected in July
and August after the exudations have ceased. It
is a hard, tough substance more or less white
according to its purity in very irregular flattened
shapes and in tortuous vermicular filaments. It
contains aside from a little gum and starch, a
consistent plant-mucilage without smell or taste
and it is used in technical ways, in printing of
textile fabrics and finishing, in producing plastic
masses, as a binding medium for the production of
confections and in the book-bindery for marbling
size.</p>

<p>The leaf tragacanth of Smyrna is the best. It
is brought to the markets of the world via
Constantinople or via Smyrna in boxes of 100 to
200 lbs.</p>

<p>It forms flat ribbon-like pieces which consist of
peculiar layers of horn-like consistency, white and
diaphanous; when broken it is dull and splintered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>An inferior quality is the tragacanth of Morea,
which generally comes from Greece via Trieste.
This consists of oddly shaped, peculiarly twisted
pieces, partly of pure white, partly of yellowish and
brownish colors. For a long while, tragacanth
was known as a good material for marbling size and,
for that reason, it is used to-day in a good many of
our book-binderies for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is much more liked than carrageen moss
because the consistency of its mucilage and its
durability are great and the preparation of the
colors does not demand such great attention. But
since my experiments and investigations upon the
excellent effects of borax on the durability of
carrageen size have become known, tragacanth has
lost much of its popularity, because with it the
edges can never be produced in a similar fine way
as with carrageen size and besides the price is
higher. Tragacanth is one of these short-viscous
plant mucilages which swell in cold water but do
not give a perfectly homogeneous solution. The
mucilage consists of innumerable small granules,
in which the starch is enclosed by cells.</p>

<p>These small granules prohibit, within the first
two or three days of a fresh tragacanth size, the
drawing of edges, as they make the colors thrown
on appear rugged, and in drawing injure the fine
hair lines. Five or six days after the dissolving of
the tragacanth, the mucilage becomes more homogeneous
and therefore better adapted for marbling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>If the swelled up mucilage is boiled, after the
first or second day, then the solution will become
perfectly homogeneous and will be as good as
carrageen size except that the colors, which
normally spread out on carrageen size, will expand
much more on tragacanth size as it possesses
more consistency and therefore they will become
paler. The more dense the size, the thicker colors
and the less gall is necessary to produce a normal
expansion. The same difference in the power of
expansion of the colors as in carrageen and the
tragacanth is noticed in colors which normally
spread out on tragacanth but which, very largely,
expand on the size of plantago-psyllium (flea-bane)
because the latter has the most consistency and
homogeneity of them all. The different effects of
the varieties of size on the colors are due to the
consistency and to the different conditions of
gravity. The objections of the consumers of my
marbling colors who use tragacanth, are, that they
consider the edges too pale. The cause of this is
that my products are only prepared for carrageen
size, inasmuch as my investigations have shown
that it is the best, the cheapest and the most
adapted for all varieties of edges.</p>

<p>The homogeneousness of the tragacanth mucilage
in cold solution comes naturally after the size is
five or six days old, because within this time fermentation
of lactic acid occurs, which opens the
cells of the small granules of starch while at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
same time boiling heat has an immediate result in
the same direction.</p>

<p>As soon as these cells are opened the formation
of acids of the sugary parts and the fermentation
of lactic acid of the starch contained in the size
take place as fast as in any other variety of size,
hence the size of tragacanth has no superiority over
any other, besides the best, or picked-leaf tragacanth
of Smyrna costs about four times the price of
the best Carrageen.</p>

<p>For the preparation of the size, take 3 ounces
of tragacanth, pour two quarts of water over it,
leave it stand for 24 hours, then stir well and leave
it standing for 12 hours more, repeat this until the
homogeneous thick mucilage has been produced,
then add 4 quarts of water, again stir it up well
and filter it and the size is ready for the marbling
process.</p>

<p>For tragacanth size, colors of great consistency,
mostly fine earth colors are the best. They must
be ground exceedingly well and very little ox-gall
is to be added. But as these earth colors lack in
the power to spread out and in divisibility, a
characteristic of colors prepared for carrageen size,
and as they never will have such fineness and
smoothness, always appearing rugged, it is impossible
for me to recommend gum tragacanth for
the preparation of size.</p>

<p>I must mention further an effect, which earth
colors exert on tragacanth size, viz., that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
can be used on paper not prepared with alum,
without running, while this is not the case with
colors, which were prepared for the Carrageen size.
In another chapter upon ox-gall I shall explain
why the colors used with Carrageen size must be
transferred on alum paper.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<span class="lin2">AND THE OTHER GELATINOUS BODIES.</span></h2>


<p>Radix salep are called the dried tubers of
several species of orchids, they are round, quite
flat, yellowish white, horn-like, semi-diaphanous,
very hard and without taste or smell. Formerly
salep was imported mostly from Persia, but now
the tubers of orchids grown at home are collected
and do not in any way differ from those coming from
Asia. They contain a good quantity of gum and
on that account are used for finishing silks and
for medicinal purposes. It is sold ground, or as
powder and can be bought at every drug-store. As
marbling size, salep possesses very excellent properties,
similar to carrageen moss, but its high price
prohibits its general application. In preparing
size, use, to 6 quarts of water 2-1/2 ounces of
powdered salep which must be well boiled for a
long period so that it may become entirely dissolved.
After standing 24 hours, it can be used in the
same way, as carrageen size.</p>

<p>Plantago-Psyllium (Flea-bane, Flohsamen,
Flohkrautsamen) is the seed of different species of
Way Bread belonging to the family of the plantaginea
viz., plantago-psyllium, Pl-Arenaria, Pl-Cynops,
the second of which is found in Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, etc. on sandy
fields, the other two on the sea-shores of southern
Europe.</p>

<p>The seed is small with one side flat and the
other concave and has a furrow upon which is
located the eye or navel. It is lustrous and of a
reddish brown color, the best varieties coming
from southern France. In consequence of the
great quantity of plant-mucilage or gum, that it
contains, by treating with hot water a consistent
mucilage or size is obtained and used in the
manufacture of marbled paper and for finishing
textile fabrics.</p>

<p>To prepare the size, place 4 ounces of flea-bane
in a wide wooden tub, pour 6 quarts of boiling water
over it and beat well with a switch of wicker-rods
until the gum is entirely separated from the seeds,
allow it to cool and after 10 or 12 hours filter
through a linen cloth, when it is ready for use.
The mucilage of flea-bane is quite homogeneous
and of great consistency, is very viscous, forming
strings very readily and is therefore not used for
drawn edges since the colors will be drawn along
by the stylus without being cut. It is mostly
used for producing thickly veined, ordinary
marbled edges, but flea-bane size is also much
more expensive than that of carrageen moss and
on the other hand its quality is so much inferior
to that of the other that I cannot recommend it
for use as size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>I will briefly mention the other vegetable matters
containing an especially large quantity of gum or
mucilage, but which have not come into use for
preparing marbling size on account of their cost
and of the less consistency of their mucilages.</p>

<p>The richest in this regard are the seeds of
quinces and linseed. Their mucilage is as viscous
as that of flea-bane. Much less gum is contained
in the leaves of mallows of colts-foot or of marsh-mallows.</p>

<p>In closing this chapter upon the mucilages of
plants and their applications as sizing for marbling
I again recommend carrageen moss as the best
size, because it has given me during my investigations
and in practice, surprising results of its
usefulness for all kinds of marbled edges.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="OX-GALL" id="OX-GALL"></a>OX-GALL.</h2>


<h3>THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF OX-GALL.</h3>

<p>In the bile of every animal are two peculiar acids
both containing nitrogen. One of them free of
sulphur, the other containing it, both by boiling
with acids and alkalis yield the same acid free of
nitrogen, which is called cholic acid.</p>

<p>If these two acids be separated from each other
in a chemical way we obtain glycocholic acid, an
acid free of sulphur and the other taurocholic acid
containing sulphur. The alkali salts contained in
bile are quite soluble in water or alcohol but
insoluble in ether. To produce it in a pure state
mix the bile with as much animal coal, (spodium)
so that finally, on evaporation in the water-bath a
dry powder results, from which is drawn, by the
use of absolute alcohol, the now colorless cholic acid
esters, cholesterine, choline, lactic acid, etc.
When ether containing a little water is added,
the cholic acid esters are precipitated as colorless
plaster-like masses and crystallize, when left in the
fluid for some time.</p>

<p>The so-called crystallized bile is the final
material for the preparation of acids. The acids
of ox-gall have been investigated in the most
thorough manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Glycocholic acid is obtained as a colorless precipitate
from a watery solution of crystallized ox-gall, by
adding dilute sulphuric acid until the fluid becomes
flocculent, which after a while, especially, if the
water contains a little ether, is changed into a
voluminous 'magma' of fine white needles.</p>

<p>If collected upon a filter, these needles unite and
form a lustrous felt.</p>

<p>Glycocholic acid is sparingly soluble in water
but soluble in alcohol. It forms the principal
constituent of bile, it reacts feebly with acid and tastes
bitter-sweet. Taurocholic acid is found only in
small quantities in ox-gall and has no important
effect on the colors.</p>


<h3>THE EFFECT OF OX-GALL UPON COLORS.</h3>

<p>By chemical analysis we have seen that glycocholic
acid is the principal constituent of ox-gall and in
combination with taurocholic acid, glycin, choline
and lactic acid is soluble in water. On the other
hand, when pure, it is soluble with difficulty and
therefore is only of use to us when in combination
with other acids, as it must combine intimately
with water-colors.</p>

<p>The atomic weight of gall and the insolubility of
pure glycocholic acid in water are the most
valuable properties of it for the marbling colors.</p>

<p>The first gives to the colors the expanding power,
the latter the adhesion to paper.</p>

<p>All the lower fatty acids, among which ox-gall
may be numbered, possess properties similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fatty bodies, namely a less atomic weight than
water. They differ from fatty bodies in this, that
they mix with water.</p>

<p>The expanding power and lightness of ox-gall
are, consequently, peculiarities of equal value.
Marbling size forms the base for the colors, which
by the consistency of the glutinous mass and by
the gall added to them are prevented from sinking
to the bottom. They float like drops of oil upon
the water and only differ from them by the fact
that the colors will spread out on the size, while
the drops of oil on the water are contracted to
circular spots of small size. If a drop of oil were
thrown upon the size it would spread out very
quickly.</p>

<p>This purely physical occurrence is caused by the
different weights of the bodies and the consistency
of the size. The fatty bodies, which are much
lighter than water, float upon it but the gravity of
the drop itself prohibits its spreading out, as it
sinks somewhat and is held together by it. It is
different with the size; by the consistency of the
glutinous mass the gravity of the drop is
antagonized and as a result it flattens and spreads
out.</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned the insolubility of
glycocholic acid binds the color to the paper. To
explain this I will mention a few examples; the
saturated alum solution will cause glycocholic
acid to curdle. If, therefore, we add to ox-gall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
which is basic the saturated solution of alum, a
soft plaster-like mass is precipitated which consists of
glycocholate of aluminium, insoluble in water.
This chemical reaction explains the durability of
the colors. If we desire to marble books or papers
we impregnate them with alum water, allow them
to dry partly and take the edge from the size.</p>

<p>In the same moment that the paper soaked with
alum comes in contact with the colors, the latter
become bound by the formation of glycocholates of
aluminium and do not run. They have
the same property of fixing colors that
resinous soaps used in the paper manufacture for
gluing machine paper have. If this resinous soap
were not too strongly basic, which is injurious to
many colors, it might be applied as a surrogate for
ox-gall.</p>

<p>As the resinous soap on account of its binding
quality and insolubility could also be used in
marbling with such colors, upon which it exercises
no injurious effect, I will here give its preparation
and former use in the manufacture of paper. If
2-5 ounces of rosin be boiled with 1-1/3 ounces
of sodium lye and if you add by teaspoonful from
time to time so much lye until a sample of it is
dissolved by hot water to a clear fluid, the mass on
cooling congeals and forms a quite solid soap. If
we mix a solution of resinous soap with one of
alum then we obtain an insoluble compound of
resinous acids and aluminium. In this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
resinous soap is used in gluing paper by adding
to the paper pulp, first resinous soap and then a solution
of alum. During this process a thin layer of
insoluble soap of aluminium is formed around
every particle of the paper and thus the running
of the ink is prohibited. The same process
occurs with ox-gall contained in the colors, when
the edge is lifted off on paper or book-edges
impregnated with alum, by which the running of
the colors is prohibited.</p>


<h3>THE PREPARATION OF OX-GALL AND ITS USES.</h3>

<p>The preparation of ox-gall to be used in
marbling is simple. Take a quart of fresh bile
(ox-gall or fish-gall), place in a bottle which
contains when filled from 1-1/2 to 2 quarts, add 1/2 pint
of absolute alcohol, shake well and leave stand for
from 14 days to 3 weeks. Within this time all
particles of gum and all fatty substances which
are present in some galls in comparatively large
quantities, will fall to the bottom and the gall will
be thin-fluid, pure and diaphanous, brownish,
yellow or greenish according to the nourishment
of the animal from which it was taken.</p>

<p>Cow-gall contains more gum and fatty substances,
than ox-gall; fish-gall, on the other hand, is
thinner than ox-gall and would be the most useful
of them all, if it could be obtained in sufficient
quantities. If the gall is thin and pure it is
filtered through paper which is easily and quickly
done as it runs like water. If by filtering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
dregs of the gall the filter should become clogged,
a new one must be used.</p>

<p>The addition of alcohol causes the precipitation
of glutinous and fatty substances and preserves
the gall from decomposition. If prepared in such
a way it can be preserved for years without spoiling.</p>

<p>All colors which we intend to use for marbling
must be bound to bodies absolutely insoluble in
water; it is therefore a mistake to say, that the
colors dissolve in water. You may grind the color
on a marble slab or in a machine as long as you
please, but you will only obtain a great degree of
fineness of the bodies but never a dissolution of the
same.</p>

<p>Each body possesses its limit of divisibility; in
amorphous bodies the high divisibility is but natural,
but in crystalline bodies this division must be produced
by grinding or washing.</p>

<p>The gall does not combine with these bodies, nor
does it penetrate them, but only clings to them
loosely. It can be readily removed in case the
colors should be rendered useless by the addition
of too much gall. The color is allowed to precipitate
in the bottle and the water standing above is
poured off, fresh water is added and this manipulation
is repeated several times.</p>

<p>The gall which surrounds every particle of color
forms, as it were, the support of it and adapts it to
float upon the size.</p>

<p>Bodiless colors, which give a complete solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with water will run into each other on being thrown
on the size and will flow from the paper when it is
lifted off. The insolubility of the color bodies
therefore prevents them from running although
they are disarranged on the size in drawing and
although one color may be compressed or expanded
by a second, yet they all remain separate without
mixing, except, perhaps, that the shade of the first
color becomes more intense, because its color particles
are pushed together by the more violent
expansion of the second color.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that the colors, to be
useful for our purposes, must be thoroughly insoluble.
The gall is added during the process of
grinding the color, so that the particles of colors
are fully surrounded by the gall. The gall has an
excellent effect on the colors but it also can act
very injuriously if the necessary precautions are
not taken. Carelessness is mostly the reason that
the edges do not possess the demanded lustre of
color and why they appear pale, as the marbler often
uses the gall too soon when he notices the smallest
obstacle, (due in most cases to the size.) It is
therefore not astonishing that brilliant comb or
peacock-edges are so rarely seen.</p>

<p>It is an obstacle to marbling, that the gall mixes
so easily with the size. It often happens that the
gall spoils the size before an edge was ever produced
on it. This happens especially when the size on
which the colors are prepared according to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
method, is too thick. The size is frequently soiled
and spoiled when the colors are prepared, because
the colors can not be perfectly drawn off on thick
size. There will always remain some particles
which will not only soil the size but impregnate it
with gall, and which will cause the entire uselessness
of size and color.</p>

<p>A very consistent size will make the preparation
of colors extremely difficult, as they need a double
quantity of gall for the purpose of spreading out.
If there is but one color used, the preparation on
such a size would be possible without spoiling it,
but with four colors this is entirely impossible
because the repeated drawing off of the colors,
which always leaves particles behind, will, by and
by, impregnate the size so that when the fourth
color is prepared the first will not spread out any
further.</p>

<p>The more the impregnation of the gall and size
increases, the power of expansion of the colors
decreases and this continues until both materials
are useless.</p>

<p>It is therefore advisable, as I have already stated,
in the chapter upon the varieties of sizes that the
colors should be prepared separately on a small
part of size to determine the correct consistency of
the latter and to prohibit the whole size being
soiled.</p>

<p>The gall should be kept in a small bottle
containing about 1/10 quart with a perforated stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>per
from which a small tube protrudes and from
which the gall can be added to the colors in drops.</p>

<p>Although the preparation of the color in this
way takes more time, this trouble is amply repaid
by the result.</p>

<p>Fatty bodies are injurious to the size, therefore
they must be carefully avoided because they have
the same effect as the gall, they form, although not
insoluble in water, a combination with the size and
prohibit the colors from spreading out. Fatty
bodies can be transferred by glutinous fluids into a
state of the most minute division and they then
form emulsions.</p>

<p>Natural emulsions are milk, the yolk of egg,
and the milky saps of plants. For this reason, in
many establishments raw milk is used as a
propelling medium for hair-veined edges.</p>

<p>There are also fatty bodies which, in an artificial
way, form an emulsion even with water; for
instance, almond, poppy and hemp, if they are
ground to a pulp with a little water yield a milky
mixture. All these emulsions artificial as well as
natural, can be employed as expanding mediums
and give better results for marbling than petroleum
or naptha.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>There are rosins which are soluble in ammonia
or borax. These solutions possess properties
similar to gall and either can be used as an
expanding medium or as an addition to colors.
Different experiments with these solutions gave
very good results.</p>

<p>To produce them pour a quart of water into a
vessel, warm, add 2/5 of an ounce of shellac or
rosin and a 1/100 part of a quart of ammonia or
2/5 of an ounce of borax so that the rosin becomes
dissolved, and then bring the mixture to a boiling
temperature.</p>

<p>Ammonia dissolves the rosins much more quickly
and thoroughly than borax, but the solution in
ammonia has the property of gelatinizing the
colors after they have remained standing a short
time. They therefore can only be used in a
greatly diluted condition. The borax solution, on
the other hand, has no such effect; not even the
concentrated solution. I mention these two solutions
especially, to instigate further investigations.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SPRINKLING_WATER" id="SPRINKLING_WATER"></a>SPRINKLING WATER.</h2>


<p>Sprinkling water is one of the newer discoveries in
the art of marbling and deserves full consideration
on account of its good properties. Its advantages
consist in this, that it produces circular forms
upon the size and has a greater expanding power
than gall.</p>

<p>Sprinkling water is used for hair-veined edges
and as an addition to the ground color in marbling.</p>

<p>To prepare it take 1-1/2 ounces of Venetian soap,
finely chipped, place them in a pot with a quart of
alcohol, warm up some water in a second and large
vessel in which the pot containing the alcohol and
soap is put, bring the whole to boiling, when the
soap will be entirely dissolved in the alcohol.
Keep a quintuple quantity of water in readiness
into which the solution of soap is poured and stir
well, the sprinkling water is then ready for use.
The solution of soap in alcohol is carried out in a
water-bath to avoid the ignition of the volatile
vapors which are generated by this process. The
alcohol prevents the foaming of the soap, the soft
water the curdling.</p>

<p>The solution when ready is to be kept in a closed
bottle.</p>

<p>Generally to the colors which are used for hair-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>veined
edges and marble more gall is added than to
those used for drawn edges. It is, therefore, easily
understood that with these, a more intensively
acting expanding medium must be used to spread
out the strong colors into veins.</p>

<p>The sprinkling water is here of great service,
because, although ox-gall in its pure state possesses
a sufficient expanding power it is here more
desirable to produce beauty of forms. In this respect
the gall is much inferior to sprinkling water,
the former producing all kinds of forms, the latter
only beautifully round and oval ones.</p>

<p>For marbling, the ground color is prepared with
gall so far, until it slightly pushes the other colors
aside and then, by and by, so much sprinkling
water is added until the desired expanding power
is reached.</p>

<p>Every ground color which is prepared with
sprinkling water spoils on standing two or three
days becoming slimy and viscous, and, for
economy's sake, not more color should be prepared
with sprinkling water than is required for one
marbling process.</p>

<p>For hair-veined edges, the sprinkling water is
used in the same way as gall. Use a large painter's
brush or whisk and move the colors by beating
into veins, with this brush or whisk through a slot,
or throw the sprinkling-water upon the color by
means of the sprinkling brush and sieve. In both
cases the same result will be achieved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chpg" title="">ALUM WATER.</h2>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="ALUM_WATER" id="ALUM_WATER"></a>ALUM WATER.</h2>


<p>In the chapter upon gall I have mentioned in a
general way the action of alum water upon the
edges, it remains only therefore to explain the
preparation and application of the same.</p>

<p>To achieve beautiful results from the colors it is
indispensable to wet the book edges or the paper,
to be marbled, with concentrated alum water, so
that no spot is left free from moisture, because at
that spot the color would not take.</p>

<p>Concentrated alum water is prepared in the
following way; put 2 quarts of water and 13
ounces of alum into a pot and heat until the
alum is entirely dissolved. This concentrated
solution is permitted to cool and is bottled tightly.</p>

<p>A solution of alum in cold water is much too
weak for the above purpose as alum is but sparingly
soluble in cold water.</p>

<p>The book edge or paper, which is to be marbled,
is wet with a sponge dipped into this cold
concentrated alum solution and must be allowed to
dry for from 5 to 8 minutes, after which the
produced edge may be lifted from the size. Generally
this point finds but too little consideration
in our book-binding establishments.</p>

<p>Edges which have not been treated with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
alum water show as a consequence poor and blotted
results, although such little trouble is necessary to
wet the edges with alum water.</p>

<p>With hair-veined edges, where colors are thrown
on the size only in very small quantities, this
wetting may be omitted; but with comb, peacock
and bouquet edges, for which four to six colors are
used, it is unavoidably necessary to prepare the
edges with alum water because the glycocholate
aluminium formed by the color while in connection
with the alum water is essential to fix the color in
such quantities.</p>

<p>Therefore, if it is desired to produce clean and
lustrous edges in which the white lines appear
without a trace of color, then this advice is to be
followed, the small trouble being amply repaid
by the beauty of the edges.</p>

<p>Ordinary earth and several of the lake-colors take
without wetting of edges with alum water, but
these colors leave much to be desired in their
divisibility and fineness and always appear rugged.</p>

<p>A much finer fixing medium is the acetate of
aluminium which can be easily produced.</p>

<p>Dissolve 1 pound of alum in 3 quarts of
warm water, prepare another solution with the
same quantity of soda, mix these two, whereupon
the hydrate of aluminium is precipitated. Allow
the latter to settle, pour the water above carefully
off, and filter; the white body which remains
consists of hydrate of aluminium which is readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dissolved by a little acetic acid, into a clear fluid
and can be diluted with the same volume of water.
Then heat the whole liquid, when the excess of
acetic acid is evaporated, we have the desired
acetate of aluminium which can be used in the
same way as alum water.</p>

<p>Edges and paper which are to be marbled should
only be moistened with alum water or aluminium
acetate shortly before the marbling and should
stand not longer than a half-hour after the sizing
of the edges, because later on, an insoluble layer
is formed which only takes color with great
difficulty. It is therefore best to prepare the
colors before commencing the sizing of the edges.
If there are a large number of books, it is better to
divide them into two or three lots.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PREPARATION_OF_THE_COLORS" id="THE_PREPARATION_OF_THE_COLORS"></a>THE PREPARATION OF THE COLORS<br />FOR MARBLING.</h2>


<p>The want of knowledge of colors gave me the
greatest trouble when I began their manufacture
as I had no information as to why this or that
color was unfit for marbling.</p>

<p>The numberless experiments I made to this end
remained without results. It was an exceedingly
great trial to my patience, but by the pertinacity
with which I clung to my investigations, I, at last,
succeeded in making the important discovery, that
the real value of color for marbling purposes is its
body and that the color itself, which is bound to
the body either naturally or chemically, is of less
importance. By this discovery every difficulty
that I had so long experienced was cleared away
and it was made manifest, why it had been
impossible for the marbling art to become sufficiently
popular.</p>

<p>From this time on I had a foundation, upon
which to continue my investigations with greater
surety. Finally I succeeded in finding that the
colors named later on are good and useful marbling
colors.</p>

<p>When we look over the different special branches
of our trade, we find everywhere great progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which is even noticeable in the smallest workshop.
Already, these wonderful achievements have become
common property, only the art of marbling
stood still on account of insufficient instruction
and it has not made any progress in the last
decade. This was due to a large number of men
in our trade using mechanical marblers to
avoid those obstacles, which had hitherto offered
themselves in marbling.</p>

<p>The expectations which were placed on the
mechanical marblers were not fulfilled, because,
after a short use, and when not carefully kept clean,
they became sticky from dust and color mixing so
that they gave but very indifferent productions.
The necessity of continually cleaning these mechanical
marblers and their lack of uniformity are by
no means recommendable properties.</p>

<p>Mechanical marblers should be retired to small
book-binderies for use upon single books, where
they are eminently in the right place, driving
away the primitive sprinkled or starched edges.</p>

<p>The interest which was shown in mechanical
marblers is a proof that all members of our trade,
who use them, possess a liking for the marbling
art and would be zealous friends of the same, if
they but knew of the methods of marbling, that
would give beautiful results without great difficulty.</p>

<p>To judge rightly the value of a new invention,
we have only to see, whether it is introduced into
the wholesale trade and is in continual use. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is the best test of inventions and the only proper
basis, upon which to judge them correctly. We
find the mechanical marblers exclusively in the
small shop, because they do not answer the
demands of the wholesale manufacturer in any
way.</p>

<p>What the marbling art is able to offer, a person
can only judge, who has seen exemplary edges
and to whom marbling is not a stranger. No
kind of edge, to which color is applied, can be
compared to the effective splendor of marbled
edges. In thousands of variations it imitates
nature and delights the eye by its products.
Although marbling has hardly reached the middle
rung of the ladder of its development, it to-day
stands unrivalled.</p>

<p>It is clear, that such an art should be fostered
and nursed, if it is to grow to its full development.
But here the investigation of one man is insufficient,
a general interest is demanded and I hope,
that this will be aroused by my work. After this
slight diversion I will now begin to treat my real
subject, the preparation of colors, and for that
purpose, I will divide the marbling art into three
important parts: the size, the color and the
technical application.</p>

<p>The size and the technical application of
the colors demand great attention and practice;
on the other hand, the preparation of colors but
labor. The colors are divided into two groups,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
mineral and lake colors. In the lake colors, if
they are good and strong, the coloring matter
bound to the metallic oxides is equal to one-half of
the whole weight of the color, therefore they can
be prepared as good marbling colors without
adding anything but gall. On the other hand, in
mineral colors, which in a natural or chemical way
are bound to bodies, the body weighs much more
than the coloring substance and even if the
metallic oxide is the real coloring substance, as is
the case with ferric hydrate, the organic coloring
matters derived from the vegetable or animal
kingdom are preferable to the inorganic substances.</p>

<p>Why this is the case we shall see further on.
In those coloring substances, which I have recommended
as good marbling colors, the aggregate state
of the body is amorphous and admits of the greatest
divisibility. If such a coloring substance is ground
in the finest way possible, the division of the body
is a very great one, but an intimate union of the
particles can never take place because first, the
color is insoluble in water and, second, because the
division (diminution) of a body has its limits. For
this reason particles are isolated and lay loosely
alongside of each other.</p>

<p>If a mineral color is mixed with the necessary
amount of water and gall and thrown upon the size
the drop expands to a round disc, which upon close
investigation, is found to consist of numberless
small dots. When such coloring stuffs are used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the union of the particles must be brought about
by some glutinous matter. This is unnecessary
with lake colors, where the coloring matter is as
heavy as the body to which it is bound, as all
organic substances possess a sufficient quantity of
glutinous matter to form a union of the particles.</p>

<p>The clearest proof of the correctness of my
allegations we find in a mineral color, in which the
metallic oxide was precipitated by a semi organic
salt, I mean French blue, which without any
substance unites the particles quite well if the
washing of the precipitate after the blueing, was a
perfect one.</p>

<p>The glutinous matter used with mineral colors
must be entirely free of any acids as the smallest
particle of acid, which in warm weather is often
formed after long standing causes an isolation of
the coloring matter in such a way, that it will
become curdled when thrown upon the size. The
best glutinous matter, that can be used, is dissolved
isinglass or parchment-glue with gum tragacanth.
As the first two named materials are expensive
they can be replaced by fine gum arabic free of
acid. Take 4/6 of an ounce of gum tragacanth let
it swell in 1 pint of water and dissolve fully by
boiling. In this way we obtain a glutinous mass,
which is mixed by stirring with a thick solution
of gum-arabic. This mixture is used to unite the
particles of the body of mineral colors.</p>

<p>To grind the colors use a very smooth marble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
slab, a roller and a palette knife, of wood or horn,
as those of steel produce some change upon red
colors.</p>

<p>The colors which are sold in the market are
either in the form of grooved pieces, little cones, or
powder. If the color is in pieces or little cones, it
is first ground to powder in a dry state and is then
mixed with a little water and from 10 to 15 drops
of ox-gall to a thick paste. If a mineral color, add
a piece of the glutinous matter the size of a nut, if,
on the contrary, we have a lake color, the addition
of water and gall is fully sufficient.</p>

<p>Now commences the grinding. With a muller
you continually run in a circular motion over the
color using a moderate pressure of the hands. After
about two or three hours have elapsed the color
will have the requisite fineness which is shown
by its greasy, lacquer-lustrous appearance. During
the grinding, move the color from time to time into
the center of the marble with the palette knife and
at the same time the adhering color is removed
from the roller.</p>

<p>When the color is ground fine it must be diluted
with water in a glass vessel and is then ready for
use. Bottle tightly and keep it in a cool place,
best in the cellar.</p>

<p>For grinding the colors and diluting the same,
river or rain water should be used, of course,
proportionately to the quantity of color so that the
latter will not become too thin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The grinding of a color is done mostly by
apprentices as the time of a journeyman would be
too valuable. In most cases this part of the
preparation gives the greatest trouble, since the
colors are seldom gotten to that fineness necessary
to marbling. This is easily explained as the
grinding demands practice and a certain perseverance.
From the point of view that time is money,
the majority of book-binders concluded to use
ready ground colors and this was profitable to
them as they could buy them better and finer
ground and much cheaper. But, even here, we
sometimes find articles, which leave much to be
desired, but which, in most cases, can be used.</p>

<p>For fifteen years I have been carrying on the
manufacture of marbling colors and must always
endeavor to keep pace with the progress of the
chemistry of the colors as new products are
continually offered for sale superior to the old in
quality and beauty.</p>

<p>To give to the trade an idea of the manufacture
of marbling colors I will briefly describe it.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that among the great
number of colors produced by a factory, there are
always several, which excel by their especially
good quality. I selected, therefore, from among
the colors of several factories, those which were
especially excellent and I now control an assortment,
which hardly any single factory is able to
supply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In preparing them 20 pounds are always ground
at once. The color is ground upon a large marble
slab with water and gall, to mineral colors the
necessary glutinous matter is added and this is
formed to a thick paste and then ground in the
color-mill. The grinding in the mill is essential
to obtain a homogeneous mass and then this paste
is ground twice on a color grinding machine with
three porphyry rollers in the finest possible way.</p>

<p>The color having been diluted is then
prepared on a size, which is gotten up for
this purpose and then preserved in stone jugs.</p>

<p>It is easily explainable, that the best results must
be obtained with such a carefully and excellently
prepared color, I, therefore recommend to my
fellow marblers, the marbling colors manufactured
by me.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Before using, the color must always be well
shaken and there must only be taken from
the bottle enough necessary to one marbling
process. The remaining portion of the color must
not be poured back into the bottle, because if this
be repeated several times the whole color would be
spoiled by the gall.</p>

<p>A small quantity of, say from 40 to 50 drops of
color, is sufficient for marbling the edges of even
a large number of books, the colors must always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
be kept tightly bottled up as they may be spoiled
by being exposed to the air for a longer period.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_MARBLING_OF_BOOK_EDGES" id="THE_MARBLING_OF_BOOK_EDGES"></a>THE MARBLING OF BOOK EDGES<br />AND PAPER.</h2>


<p>The Marbling consists, generally speaking in
this, that finely ground fluid colors are thrown in
drops by the aid of brushes on a thickly fluid size
contained in a flat trough, that then by the aid of
gall, different marble-like designs are formed, that
they are lifted off the size by immersing the edge
of the book and by that are transferred on this
edge.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the different kinds of edges,
I will mention something of the harmony of colors,
as in drawn edges the real harmonious combination
of colors is of great influence on their beauty.
The application of color in the art of marbling
gives us certainly extraordinary freedom and a
wide range to our fancy, but nevertheless there are
certain principles or laws necessary to make the
colors appear in an effective and beautiful way.
Those tones of color which lie between yellow and
reddish yellow are called warm, those between blue
and the middle of reddish blue, cold colors. In the
center lies red by its strength and effectiveness
forming the dividing line between the warm and
cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>To explain the principles of color harmony, the
colors are divided into three groups, first, primary
colors, second, secondary, and third, tertiary.</p>

<p>Primary colors are those which cannot obtain
their inherent purity by any mixture, namely red,
yellow, blue, white and black. Secondary are
those which are generated by a combination of two
primary colors, for instance, orange, purple, green
and grey. Tertiary, or broken colors, are those
which are obtained by mixing two equally powerful
secondary colors, for instance, brownish red, olive,
slate grey, etc.</p>

<p>In the harmony of colors luminosity and intensity
play the main parts. The darkest color must
occupy three times as much space as the lightest
and the succession must be kept up in this way
always taking into consideration the luminosity of
the colors.</p>

<p>Which colors must now be placed alongside one
another to produce a harmonious effect? The
laws for this are founded on the peculiarity of the
power of man's vision. The eye, demands to be
satisfied, an accord of primary colors. Red requires
to annihilate one sided irritation the two primary
colors, yellow and blue. The secondary green is
obtained by a combination of yellow and blue, for
that reason green is the color demanded by red to
please the eye. But there must be a contrast of
colors, for instance light red and dark green or
dark red and light green must be brought together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The same thing is the case with other primary
colors. The primary color yellow demands the
secondary purple, blue, the secondary orange, the tertiary
color olive, the secondary orange, brownish
red and green, brimstone yellow and violet.</p>

<p>The correct treatment of the shadow tone of a
given color depends upon the knowledge of the
laws of the annihilation of color effect. As in
nature, a shadow is formed by obstructing the
light, so in the technic of coloring the shadow is
obtained by the annihilation of the light-color. By
combination of a primary color with a harmonizing
secondary color of equal strength, we obtain the
right shadow tone of the first color. In this way,
by experiments in mixing, the right shadow tones,
which form in a multi-colored edge, the gradual
transitions of primary colors can be easily detected.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_COMB_MARBLE" id="THE_COMB_MARBLE"></a>THE COMB MARBLE.<br />
<span class="lin2spec">(SEE <a href="#Table_I_Trying_of_Colors">SPECIMEN PLATES</a>.)</span>
</h2>


<p>The comb or nonpareil marble belongs to those
edges which are not so frequently used, although
it is superior in brightness and variety of colors
to other marbles, provided the combination of
colors is a correct one and there are no entire
blotches of the same color present. For the comb-marble
in general use, four colors are mostly
employed, namely black, blue, yellow and red.
To these white is added, but not as a color, as it is
formed by the stylus in drawing the colors.</p>

<p>For precaution's sake let me here repeat the
description of the preparation of colors: before
using them shake well and then pour into the
different small vessels as much of the same as is
necessary for one marbling operation only, then
put them away handy for use in the following
order, black, blue, yellow and red. Black is used
for shading all other colors, therefore, it should be
thrown on first as the ground color. As I mentioned
before, the colors are to be prepared upon a small
surface of size so that the whole size may not be
soiled, as it is nearly unavoidable during the
preparation to prevent several drops from sinking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Whether the colors are suitable to each other as
regards their expanding power or whether the size
is too thick or too thin for comb-marble is
determined in the following manner; draw off
the size in a dish, by a strip of paper, throw on a
drop of black, which if size and color are correctly
proportioned must expand to a spot of 4 inches
in diameter. If the drop does not expand in this
way the size is either too thick or more gall must
be added to the color. Add from 5 to 10 drops of
gall to the black color and repeat the experiment.
If then the color does not expand to the given
diameter take a stylus and draw it in wavy lines such
as used for comb-marble. If the color can be drawn
into beautiful straight lines, without following
the stylus, the size possesses the normal consistency
and more gall must be added to the color, until it
reaches the aforementioned diameter, but if the
color is drawn along by the stylus or cannot be
easily cut by it, then the size is too thick and must
be carefully diluted with water. If, on the other
hand, the color in drawing with the stylus should
run, then the size is too thin. This can also be
easily seen by the extraordinary quivering of the
size. Such a size cannot be used for comb-marble,
either you must add some thick size or you must
use it for common marble edges. The black color
is the key to the success of a beautiful edge; the
other colors must be prepared according to the
strength of the black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>When the ground color has spread out to the
desired dimension, throw on the black a drop of
blue, then yellow on the blue and red on the
yellow which must all expand to a diameter of 1-1/2
inches. Should this not be the case then several
drops of gall are to be added in the order aforesaid.
The three latter colors must be prepared by themselves,
and if, after throwing a drop of blue on the
black, the former does not reach the necessary
expansion, gall must be added in drops until this
is achieved, then the yellow is manipulated in the
same way.</p>

<p>When all colors are toned in regard to their
power of expansion, then and not before then, can
the marbling commence.</p>

<p>With a little experience or practice the whole
manipulation is finished in less time than it takes
to describe it.</p>

<p>Pour the size into the trough, take the top of it
off with a thin piece of wood which fits into the
trough closely, smooth it over with the wood so
that the surface is free of bubbles, then throw on,
by the aid of a hair brush, the black in the direction
of the length of the trough towards the centre
of the size in such a way that the first drop comes
in contact with the rim of the second, the second
with that of the third, the third with the fourth,
etc., so that a ribbon from 4 to 5 inches wide is
formed. Then throw on the blue in drops at both
sides of the black following the length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
trough, but the joining of the drops must be
avoided. Yellow is thrown on at both rims of the
black just as the blue was but in such a way that
each drop of blue has a yellow centre. Finally red
is thrown on the yellow so that each drop of yellow
receives a red centre. By this means we produce
a beautiful combination of colors. Then take a
thick knitting needle or a thin stylus of wood and
draw the colors in wavy lines through each other
but so that the stylus will pass the boundary of the
black. By doing this white lines will be produced
between the colors, adding at the same time, the
fifth color white which causes the marble to attain
a brighter aspect. If then the comb is drawn
across, beautiful scales will be produced.</p>

<p>The books which have been wetted shortly
before with alum water, are now placed between
boards or clamps and are dipped from right to left,
somewhat obliquely, into the trough so that the left
end of the book touches the size first, and then
with a firm hand the book is inserted towards the
right until the right end has touched the size.
This must be quickly done to avoid the formation
of air bubbles. As soon as the marble edge is
taken off, the superfluous size is carefully removed
from the edge by a moist, soft sponge so as
to prohibit moisture from penetrating too much
into the leaves of the book. In this operation
great care must be exercised to prevent the marble
edge being rubbed out or spoiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of the color is to be taken off the
size by the aid of strips of paper and this is done
in the following way: one strip is inserted into
the size at the left end of the trough in such a way
that it slightly enters the size, then by the aid of
a second strip of paper, the top of the color is taken
off beginning at the right end of the trough and
moving the film to the left till it is brought
between the two strips of paper and can be removed
from the trough into a basin which is kept
ready, to receive the waste color. If the colors are
quickly removed in this way, the size itself
remains perfectly clean even though a large number
of books be treated.</p>

<p>On good work, the book at first is only cut in
front. As soon as the front edge is marbled and
dry the book is backed, and cut at the top and
bottom; both edges are wetted with alum water
and again the colors are thrown upon the size
taking care, that the scales of the upper edge
run in the same direction towards the fore-edge
as those of the lower one. In more common
bindings, all three sides are cut together and after
the front edge is marbled and the book is rounded
and backed, the marbling of the upper and lower
edges is executed without delay.</p>

<p>The rounding of the book must be done before
the marbling of the upper and lower edges, because
the comb would become disarranged, if the rounding
were executed afterwards. Remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
always before throwing on the colors, the top of
the size must be taken off by the aid of the piece
of board, as, by evaporation, a film is formed over
the surface which does not permit the expanding
of the colors. The quicker the marbling is
executed, so much more beautiful will be the edges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Peacock marble is one of the newest and
prettiest of marbles. It has been much used in
recent times for end papers of books, which receive
the same edges and in this connection gives a
beautiful effect. The method of preparation is
generally the same as that of the comb-edge, the
difference being this, that, after the colors have
been drawn by the stylus into wavy lines, it is
drawn by the aid of a movable comb, (the
preparation of which I shall describe among the
tools) in such a way, that for a distance of 1/2 inch
the comb is made wider and again after a distance
of 1/2 inch is made narrower. This is continued
until the entire marble is crossed by this opening
and closing comb; of which a trial is all that is
necessary to make it all clear.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that from among the drawn
marbles the bouquet marble is one of the most
brilliant, as it can be compared to a number of
buttonieres placed alongside each other, if the
combination of colors is a good one.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of colored paper, the bouquet
marble is mostly produced from two or three browns
and one black, and is often used for lining end
papers in fine books.</p>

<p>After the colors have been thrown on, drawn
by the stylus and combed in the ordinary way,
a rake-like wooden instrument is moved through
the colors right and left across the whole
surface of the size so that in moving the
rake the teeth of the second row trace those of the
first row precisely, and so on until the rake
has been moved over the whole surface from the
right end of the trough to the left. A somewhat
changed design is produced by treatment of the
colors in the same way leaving out the marbling
comb and spreading the drops of color thrown on
only by the aid of the stylus into very narrow
cross-lines and then using the aforementioned rake
as already explained. The rake consists of a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of board of hard wood, of about 1 inch less in
length, than the width of the trough, 1-1/4 inches
wide and 1/2 inch thick, into which are inserted
two rows of sharply pointed wooden teeth about 1
inch distant from each other and leaving a space of
about 1 inch between the two rows, in such a way
that the teeth of the second row are situated
precisely between the teeth of the first row.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>This comb-marble, produced by drawing the
comb back, is a great favorite on account of its
beautiful designs, but is more adapted for thicker
books as on those only can the pattern be seen to
full advantage.</p>

<p>The production is entirely the same as that of
comb marbles, but the teeth of the comb must be
about 1/2 inch distant from each other and the comb
must be 1/2 inch less in width than the trough so
that it can be moved right and left at will, when
the marble is drawn by this comb the latter is
drawn back in such a way that the teeth cross the
centre of the scales.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The production of this marble is very simple.
The colors are thrown on as for comb-marble and are
drawn by the stylus into wavy lines and then, one
by one, by the aid of the stylus, snail forms are
produced.</p>


<h3>THE GRAY SNAIL MARBLE.</h3>

<p>The manner of production is the same as that of
the plain gray marble, with the exception that so
much green is added till a desired tone is obtained.
After this ground-color has been thrown on, the
marble is drawn by the aid of the stylus into snails
and then taken off.</p>


<h3>THE COMMON GREENISH-GRAY SNAIL MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce this the colors are thrown on in the
following order, black, light-blue (two parts water,
one part Oriental blue,) Indian yellow, pink, light
red, gall water, and, finally, the body color,
composed of one part black and two to three parts
sprinkling water according as the demand is for a
lighter or darker body color. Throw the colors on
the same as in producing the grey marble, (see
<a href="#MARBLED_EDGES">marbled edges</a>) and when the ground color is
thrown on draw the marble into snails and take off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE DARK BLUE SNAIL MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To all the dark marbles, which should have an
especially brilliant effect, and are adapted for light-colored
bindings, there is always added one or two
parts of a solution of shellac and ammonia to the
body color, in addition to sprinkling water. To
produce this marble take black, light brown, light
blue, (one part Indigo, two parts white,) lemon
yellow, gall water and the body-color, which
consists of two parts Indigo, one part black, from
one to two parts sprinkling water and the same
quantity of shellac-ammonia solution. After everything
is thrown on the snails are formed.</p>


<h3>THE DARK-RED SNAIL-MARBLE.</h3>

<p>This marble has a beautiful effect and is especially
adapted for fine half bindings with light-colored
leather backs and corners and end papers
of the same pattern as the edges. To produce this
the colors are thrown on in the following order,
black, light red, pink, light gray, (four parts white,
one part black,) gall water and the body color
consisting of two parts of carmine lake, one part
of black and two parts of sprinkling water and
shellac-ammonia solution. After throwing on the
ground color the snails are drawn.</p>


<h3>THE GRAYISH-GREEN SNAIL-MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce it the colors are thrown on in the
following order, black, claret red (two parts
carmine lake and one part of black well mixed,)
pink (ten parts of white and one part of scarlet red)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
gall-water which forms the white veins, and,
finally, the body color, which consists of one part
of black, three parts of sprinkling-water and an
addition of green according to what shade of green
is desired.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS_UPON_DRAWN" id="GENERAL_REMARKS_UPON_DRAWN"></a>GENERAL REMARKS UPON DRAWN MARBLES.</h2>


<p>All marbles that are drawn by the stylus or
knitting-needle are, in their treatment, more or
less similar to the comb-marble, therefore the way
to produce them is similar to that described in the
former article upon comb-marbles.</p>

<p>To produce a pretty coloring, it is unavoidable,
to use those four colors which I have named in the
former article on comb-marble.</p>

<p>If it is desired, to use more colors than the four
named, greater perfection in marbling is essential
and it takes a perfect practical marbler to achieve
beautiful products with eight colors, but practice
and a zealous heart will even overcome these
difficulties. The lustre of the colors is due to their
combination, according to their power of spreading
out and to their harmony.</p>

<p>Wall-paper will frequently show what beautiful
and fine effects can be produced by three, or at the
most four colors.</p>

<p>If the colors are separated by white, they
develop a greater lustre, while black employed in
the same way is productive of a more sombre effect.</p>

<p>The separation of colors by white and black is
most decidedly more profitable and effective, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a marble in which the different variegated colors
immediately touch each other. It is therefore
advisable always to take black as the ground-color,
white will be produced without adding any coloring
matter whatever by the drawing of the colors
with the stylus.</p>

<p>Black is the ground-color, upon which all the
rest, blue, yellow, red are thrown; it is understood,
that they must expand in the proper proportion, to
produce a clear marble.</p>

<p>The lustre of the colors is mainly a result of
white and black, which form, as it were, a frame
about the other colors by their own durability.</p>

<p>The other colors, which we may add to the four
nonpareil colors, are, different shades of red and
yellow. A bottle is filled to one half its height
with carmine-lake, then black is added until a very
deep purple is obtained; another color is a powerful
orange, which, if not on hand, can be produced
by mixing red and yellow. To produce a beautiful
combination use the following colors, black,
light blue, orange, light yellow, purple and finally
scarlet red, (a color which I have recently
introduced under the name of safflower carmine)
this combination of colors gives a surprisingly
beautiful result. To produce the nonpareil (or
comb) marble with eight colors, two more mixed
colors are used, one of which serves as a shade to
light blue, while the other enhances the lustre of
the lighter colors. To this end, pour a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dark-blue into a glass bottle and mix it with the
same quantity of green, obtaining a dark bluish-green.
As a second color mix green and white
until the color is pale green. To produce a
desirable effect with these eight colors we must
observe the following order, black, light blue, dark
bluish-green, orange, light yellow, purple, pale
green and scarlet-red.</p>

<p>In this wise numberless variations and combinations
can be obtained, but it should always be
taken care, that the primary colors only receive
shading tones of secondary or tertiary colors. The
mode of throwing the colors on the size is always
the same as I described it for nonpareil marbles
namely; form a ribbon of black from 4 to 5 inches
in width in the prescribed way and throw the other
colors into the black and at both rims of it but so
that they are situated within the black. The same
colors which are on one rim must also be thrown
upon the other rim in the most uniform way
possible. The marble therefore, before it is drawn
is similar to a ribbon which has in its centre the
black stripe about 2 inches wide, and on each side,
a border of different colors 1 to 1-1/4 inches wide.</p>

<p>The more colors are used for the drawn marble,
the less of each color except black should be
thrown on the size. Although the colors have
been adapted to each other in regard to their power
of expansion before using them, it is indispensable
in producing these marbles with such a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
number of colors to assist the expansion of one
color or the other by a few drops of ox-gall.</p>

<p>It is necessary to see, that the second color should
not too greatly be displaced by the third, the
third by the fourth, etc., because the color, which
is mostly displaced would not appear in the marble
at all.</p>

<p>In producing peacock marbles, I obtained most
excellent results even without primary colors.
They were not so bright and lustrous in their
general color effect, but their most subdued tones
were most pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>To one of these marbles I used the colors in the
following order; black, medium olive green, dark
bluish-green, bronze or ochre yellow, dark blue
and bright chrome yellow, (to obtain the olive,
use the following mixture; 3 parts light orange,
1/2 part dark blue; bluish-green as described
above; ochre yellow, 2 parts light chrome yellow,
1 part brown; blackish-blue, 2 parts dark-blue, 1
part black; light chrome yellow, 2 parts light
orange, 2 parts white.)</p>

<p>Beautiful bouquet marbles are obtained from the
following colors; blackish-green, 2 parts black, 1
part green; yellowish-green, 2 parts yellow, 1 part
green; light-brown, dark bluish-green as above,
scarlet-red and light ochre yellow. In this way
many combinations of color can be obtained, and
it is left to the judgment of the marbler to select
colors and make the mixtures. Having succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in producing beautiful marbles with few colors,
it will be easy for anyone to produce others with
more colors.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of my colleagues are of the opinion, that
marbled edges are inferior to drawn edges, but
this is a great mistake, and here we are able to
show in what directions the marbling art is able to
develop to its full glory.</p>

<p>The field for marbled edges is so large and
prolific in the variations of shade, that there are
really no limits to its capabilities.</p>

<p>While making experiments in this field, by
accident I came across some edges without
having an idea of the effect of the combination
which so astonished me by its beauty.</p>

<p>It would be endeavoring too greatly to describe
the method of producing all effective marbled-edges
which came to my knowledge in my many years'
experience, I therefore name but a few which will
certainly invite imitation and study.</p>

<p>Marble is the design of an edge of a book,
which has a ground or back color and over which
a net of veins of different colors is stretched.</p>

<p>For the production of marbled edges, the following
preparation of size is advisable and in general
use: boil 7 quarts of water and 3-1/5 ounces of
carrageen moss, after boiling add 1 quart of cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
water, in which one ounce of common soda has
been dissolved, allow it to stand for 12 hours, and
filter it through a linen cloth when it will be ready
for use.</p>

<p>The preparation of colors is effected as with
drawn marbles on a small surface of size, but it is
necessary, that the colors for marbled edges expand
more than the others. As first color, black is
generally used, which is thrown on by a brush in
the same way as in making nonpareil marble, but
the other colors must be thrown on by a broom-corn
whisk and the more colors are used, the smaller
must be the drops of the colors which are thrown
on the size, and it is further essential that they
should be evenly divided around. Then use gall-water
which consists of 10 parts water and 1 part
gall and serves to arrange the different colors so
that one color can be concentrated in one point,
secondly, it has the effect of forming a white
network of veins, which enhances the effect of the
other colors, and finally, the ground color comes
into play, putting the whole carpet of colors into
motion. This color is nothing but a common
nonpareil color and is used either by itself or in a
mixture with other colors.</p>

<p>In preparing the ground or body color,
enough of gall is added so as to slightly
force the other colors into veins. An equal part of
sprinkling-water is added to it, to give it the
energetical power of spreading out essential to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
formation of a beautifully veined net. The body-color
is thrown on by a medium sized bristle
brush, which must be tied near the end for this
purpose. This brush is to be equally moistened
with the body color, the best would be to moisten
it by the aid of a common brush. When this is
done throw the color by beating the bristle brush
on a small board upon the carpet of colors. By
this process larger or smaller specks of the body-color
are formed.</p>


<h3>THE DARK-RED MARBLE.</h3>

<p>The marbled edges are always named from the
body-color, as the latter always occupies the
largest space on the edge. For dark-red marble
the following colors are used: black, light pink
(10 parts white, 1 part safflower-carmine), light-grey
(10 parts white, 1 part black), gall-water and,
finally, the ground color.</p>

<p>The latter is composed of 2 parts carmine-lake,
1 part black and 3 parts sprinkling-water.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_PLAIN-GRAY_MARBLE" id="THE_PLAIN-GRAY_MARBLE"></a>THE PLAIN-GRAY MARBLE.</h3>

<p>This kind of marbling is the most profitable of
the veined marbles because it can be produced
very rapidly.</p>

<p>For this purpose prepare the black color with
gall in such a way, that a drop will spread out on
the size to a spot of about 5-1/2 inches in diameter,
then add an equal quantity of sprinkling water,
dip a large broom-corn whisk or a bristle-brush
into the color and throw it by beating on a board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
upon the size which has been cleaned off by a strip
of paper. The color appears on the size a gray
color with white veins, from which the edge can be
taken.</p>


<h3>THE BLUE MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce this use the following colors; black,
orange or citron yellow, Indian red with a little
black and Oriental blue, finally adding gall water
and the body color. This ground color consists of
1 part Indigo and 1 part sprinkling water.</p>


<h3>THE BROWN MARBLE.</h3>

<p>This marble is one of the most common, but if
the colors are well selected as given in the following
paragraph it will give a fine effect.</p>

<p>Black first, Havana brown second, chamois
third, gall water, and, as ground color, humin-brown
with a little carmine lake and one part
sprinkling water.</p>


<h3>THE GRAY MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce this the following colors are necessary,
black, dark purple, light bluish green,
gall-water and a mixture of black with sprinkling
water, by which the ground shade, gray, is obtained.
A lighter or darker gray is obtained by adding
more or less sprinkling water to the ground color.</p>


<h3>THE OLIVE-GRAY MARBLE.</h3>

<p>This marble has a very beautiful effect although
in producing it but three colors are used. It
belongs to the so called large-veined marbles and
forms an olive grayish ground with a fine net of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
veins of black, dark-brown and white. It is
produced in the following way; first black is
put on with the brush, then brown is squirted on
by the aid of a broom-corn whisk and then gall
water and finally the body color is added. The
body color consists of 2 parts black, 1 part green
and the necessary sprinkling-water. If the shade of
the body color is too deep, some pure water is
added. For producing large veined marbles, the
brush must be well filled with color, so that in
throwing on of the color quite large drops will fall.</p>


<h3>THE BLACK MARBLE.</h3>

<p>It was formerly an unknown thing to produce a
black marble over which a net of light-colored veins
was stretched. My investigations have resulted in
my becoming able to produce this brilliant and
effective marble.</p>

<p>The colors used are scarlet-red, bluish-green and
gall water, the latter representing the white, this
network of veins comes out excellently from the
dark ground-tone. The scarlet-red color is first
taken and must spread out in a like way, as the
black in the other two marbles. Then follows
bluish-green and gall-water and finally the body color
is added. The latter makes a special preparation
necessary. Take 3/5 of an ounce of ivory-black add
1/6 of an ounce of a thick solution of gum, grind the
whole mixture with a mixture of shellac-ammonia
which has been diluted with a little water. If the
color is ground perfectly fine it is diluted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
solution of shellac-ammonia and is ready for use.
Should it not be powerful enough to force the
colors into veins, a few more drops of gall must be
added. This body color is likewise thrown on by
the aid of the large bristle brush as all other body
colors.</p>

<p>As beautiful as this kind of marbling may be,
there is a disadvantage in its use as the body color
must always be newly prepared, because on the
second day after standing it curdles, and cannot be
used any more.</p>


<h3>THE BLUISH-GRAY MARBLE.</h3>

<p>By mixing the colors very beautiful effects may
be obtained. One of these fine marbles is the
bluish-gray. To prepare it the following mode is
used; claret red (2 parts carmine-lake and 1 part
black) and as body color, Oriental blue mixed with
black and sprinkling-water.</p>


<h3>GRAY MARBLE WITH A NET OF COLORED VEINS.</h3>

<p>To produce this the following colors are used;
black, yellow, cinnabar-red or Indian-red, Oriental
blue and gall water and finally the gray body color.</p>

<p>The colors are put on in the following way; first
black with the brush into a ribbon-like form, then
yellow is squirted on in small drops by means of
a broom-corn whisk, then follow red, blue and gall
water which are treated like yellow, and finally,
the body color is squirted on by the aid of a whisk
or the large brush. The latter forces the colors by
its great spreading power into beautiful veins, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which the edge can be taken off. The body color
consists of 1 part black and 2 parts sprinkling water.</p>


<h3>THE GRAYISH GREEN MARBLE.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful specimens of
marble and according to the shading of the body
color most beautiful effects can be produced by it.
The following colors are used to produce it; black,
carmine-red (1 part carmine lake and 1/2 part black),
gray (1 part black and 10 parts white), finally
gall-water and the body color.</p>

<p>The mode of producing it is the same as described
before. The body color consists of 1 part black, 2
parts of sprinkling water and as much green as is
necessary to produce the desired shade.</p>

<p>Before adding sprinkling water to the body color,
black, only so much gall is added that it will but
slightly push the different colors thrown on.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chpg" title="">HAIR MARBLE.</h2>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="THE_HAIR_MARBLE" id="THE_HAIR_MARBLE"></a>THE HAIR MARBLE.
<br />
<span class="lin2spec">(SEE <a href="#Table_I_Trying_of_Colors">SPECIMEN PLATES</a>.)</span>
</h2>


<p>These marbles are in great use and are much
liked on account of their rapid and easy production,
especially when many books are to be marbled;
they appear very elegant on account of their
fineness.</p>

<p>For hair marbles but one or two colors are employed
which are diluted with water to 1/3 their
volume. Add enough of gall to the first color so
that in throwing the same on the size it will spread
sufficiently to form a ribbon from 5 to 6 inches
wide. Take a whisk and throw on the second color
in drops that are not too large and as nearly as
possible, equally distributed, then, with the bristle-brush,
or sieve and brush throw sprinkling water
on the colors. In this way hair veins are formed,
showing more or less ground according to the
quantity of sprinkling water thrown on.</p>

<p>The size is produced for all hair-marbles alike.
In the morning boil 3-1/5 ounces of carrageen moss
in 7 quarts of water and after the boiling add 1
quart of cold water, stir the whole mixture several
times and allow it to stand during the day until it
is fully cooled off. In the evening the size must
be again diluted by another quart of water and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
then filtered through a piece of linen and left to
stand over night. The next day it is ready for
use. This holds good during the summer months
as the temperature of the air will just make the
size useful for this purpose. During the winter
months the size must be allowed to stand for 36
hours before use.</p>


<h3>BLACK HAIR MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce this variety of marble there is a
screen or sieve necessary as well as a wide brush
having stiff bristles. By adding gall from time to
time, the black is made so expansive that a single
drop will be spread out to a spot of about 8 inches
in diameter. Dip the brush into sprinkling water,
shake the brush well so that the superfluous water
is thrown out, hold the sieve above the size and
move the brush quickly and lightly over it. In
this way the hair marble is finished and may be
taken off.</p>


<h3>RED HAIR MARBLE.</h3>

<p>For this to be produced the best color is Indian
or mineral red since all other chemical coloring
substances which are bound to bodies will usually
run, on strong compression, into hair veins. Only
the excellent lakes of Munich will withstand this
treatment, but the fineness of the veins leaves much
to be desired, whereas Indian red answers every
purpose.</p>


<h3>BLUE HAIR MARBLE.</h3>

<p>The mode of producing it is the same as applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in producing black hair-marble, but, instead of
black, Indigo is used. Indigo is the only one
among blue coloring matters that admits of the
necessary expansion for the production of hair
veins without running off or gathering into small
lumps.</p>


<h3>RED AND BLACK HAIR MARBLE.</h3>

<p>For the production of this marble, black and
Indian red are taken. The black is first thrown
upon the size as in black hair-vein marble, the red
is then treated by adding gall until a drop thrown
upon the black will spread to about 2 inches in
diameter. The trial is made with a brush, but for
the purpose of producing the marble a whisk is
taken, by means of which the red is thrown upon
the black in very small drops and close to each
other.</p>


<h3>BLUISH-BROWN HAIR MARBLE.</h3>

<p>To produce this marble Indigo and Vandyke
brown are taken. The Indigo is put on first then
the Vandyke brown is thrown on by a whisk,
and finally, the carpet of colors is forced into
forming veins by sprinkling water, which is applied
by aid of the brush and sieve.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="RULES_IN_REGARD_TO_THE_MARBLING" id="RULES_IN_REGARD_TO_THE_MARBLING"></a>RULES IN REGARD TO THE MARBLING<br />TABLE.</h2>


<p>The table upon which marbling is to be
executed must be firm and immovable. On it the
utensils necessary to marbling are placed. The
trough, colors, gall in a closed bottle with stopper
pierced by a tube, a vessel with water, the comb,
the size skimmer are all to be within easy reach.
They should be placed about in the following order;
in front, nearest to the workman and to the right,
the trough, the receptacle for the waste color and
board for skimming off the size to the left, beyond
the trough the vessels in which the colors and
gall are kept, behind the first vessels containing
the colors the dish containing water, and alongside
this the bottle containing gall and next to it
the comb and stylus. On the left side of the
trough there must be a sufficiently large space for
the books to be marbled.</p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="PRECAUTIONS" id="PRECAUTIONS"></a>PRECAUTIONS.</h2>


<p>Before closing the article on marbling, I will add
a few words to the precautions to be observed while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
marbling. Before all else, see that the air in the
room, where the marbling is to be done, is free of
dust, as the falling dust, especially in drawn
marbles will form many white spots, which spoil
the effect of the marbling.</p>

<p>Cleanliness should always be observed, as the
beauty of the marbles and their rapid production
depend on it. Protect the size from dust by a lid,
which you place on the vessel, and have a large
soft sponge ready to remove the superfluous size
after each immersion of the book, by which a rapid
drying is obtained and the moisture is prohibited
from impregnating the book.</p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="SUPPLEMENTARY_REMARKS" id="SUPPLEMENTARY_REMARKS"></a>SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS.</h2>


<h3>A NEW EXPANDING MEDIUM.</h3>

<p>I must mention here a newly discovered medium
which has been found essential in the formation of
beautiful veins in plain marble; take 1/10 quart
of shellac orange, add 1/8 quart spirits of ammonia,
allow the whole to boil for 5 minutes stirring
repeatedly (by which a uniform solution of shellac
in ammonia is obtained), take it from the fire and
dilute the solution with about 2 quarts of water.
Throw the fluid by means of the brush on the
size and then throw on the body-color, <i>see <a href="#THE_PLAIN-GRAY_MARBLE">plain
gray marble</a></i>. In this way beautiful white veins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
will appear, which is explained by the fact, that
the surface of the size is covered with an
expanding medium, which can be forced together
by the body-color, but is strong enough to hinder
the union of the latter.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MARBLING_OF_GILT_EDGES" id="MARBLING_OF_GILT_EDGES"></a>MARBLING OF GILT EDGES.</h2>


<p>If gilt, silver or aluminium edges are to be
marbled, burnish slightly and moisten by a soft
brush with a solution of powdered alum in hot
water which is of the consistency of a thin pap.</p>

<p>The marbling of the gilt-edge is then executed
in the usual way before the coating of alum is
entirely dry.</p>

<p>After the marbling is done, water is poured over
the edge until it is entirely clean.</p>

<p>When the edge is completely dried it is rubbed
over with a waxed rag and is then burnished in
the usual way. For marbling the usual marbling
colors are applicable, but it should here be added,
that very dry edges will not take the marbling
colors readily.</p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="MARBLING_ON_A_LARGE_SCALE" id="MARBLING_ON_A_LARGE_SCALE"></a>MARBLING ON A LARGE SCALE.</h2>


<p>For the purpose of marbling on a large scale
especial arrangements have to be made, and it is
wonderful how elegant and practical are the
marbling rooms of large establishments. For
instance the tables and floors are of stone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cement, or of wood covered with zinc plates, and
the troughs and receptacles to take off the fluids
which have been employed are to be found in universal
use. Even large iron cranes are erected to
hold the books together and lift them off, and to
transport them to the revolving drying apparatus,
which can be heated.</p>

<p>These arrangements are in keeping with the
extent of the business and can here only be lightly
passed upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="THE_UTENSILS" id="THE_UTENSILS"></a>THE UTENSILS.</h2>


<h3>THE MARBLING TROUGH.</h3>

<p>The marbling trough is a long flat oblong box
of about 20 inches in length, 10 inches wide, and
1-1/4 inches deep inside, and should be painted
within with white oil-paint so that the size appears
light making the colors more readily discernible.</p>

<p>This trough must have inserted on one side a
sloping partition of sheet zinc so that the waste of
color may be skimmed over it by aid of paper slips
or a piece of wooden board without running it over
the top.</p>

<p>In addition to the trough containing the marbling
size, a second smaller trough or basin of 10 inches
width, and 1-1/4 inches depth is necessary for
the reception of the waste of color. This is to
be placed, while marbling, immediately to the
left of the first trough.</p>


<h3>SIZE SKIMMER.</h3>

<p>This is a piece of wooden board about 2 inches
high, about 1/4 inch thick and of the exact width
of the trough. At both ends the board is slightly
wider than the trough, protruding, and while the
larger part of the board moves over the surface of
the size, the projecting ends act as guides by
sliding over the rim of the trough. In this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the board is always kept in a like position and
serves to remove the air bubbles and films and also
the color waste.</p>

<p>Recently, strips of blotting paper 1 inch wide
have been frequently and successfully used for the
removal of waste of color. They are applied in the
same manner as the board.</p>


<h3>THE STYLUS</h3>

<p>of wood or bone, is used for the drawing of the
colors in producing nonpareil marbles. This was
described in the chapter on nonpareil edges.</p>


<h3>THE COMB.</h3>

<p>For the production of nonpareil marble, the comb
is employed, made in the following way; take two
strips of heavy pasteboard, 12 inches long and
2-1/2 inches wide, divide one of these exactly where
the needles are to be inserted, draw grooves so that
the needles can be laid in; glue the part in
which the needles are to be laid, insert the needles
in the grooves as aforesaid, and, after drying, the
second strip of pasteboard, is glued upon the first.</p>

<p>The needles best adapted to comb making for
use in comb marbling are fine pearl needles of
steel; they are preferable to the common pins
because they do not bend and do not offer any
resistance to the size while drawing the colors, and
also because they cut the colors easily without
forming furrows.</p>

<p>The comb is so prepared that the pasteboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
protrudes slightly at both ends, by this the movement
of the comb is defined by the rim of the
trough. It is advisable to prepare about three
such combs with the needles separated from each
other about 3/32, 3/16 and 1/4 inch respectively.</p>


<h3>THE PEACOCK COMB.</h3>

<p>The peacock comb consists of two common combs
having strong needles separated from one another
by 1/2 inch. These two combs are put together by
means of a pasteboard frame in such a way that
they can be moved 1/4 inch to the side.</p>

<p>Moved sideways the needles of one comb move
to the centre between the needles of the other
comb, they cover each other as soon as both combs
are moved 1/4 inch in the opposite direction.</p>


<h3>THE BRUSH.</h3>

<p>To distribute the colors equally for drawn edges
it is necessary to divide the color around on the
size as explained in the chapter on nonpareil
marble. This is almost impossible if a common
brush is employed as the drops cannot be
voluntarily directed by it, I have had, therefore,
brushes made with bent bristles which make the
distribution of the drops easier.</p>


<h3>THE BROOM-CORN WHISK.</h3>

<p>This whisk is made of soft broom-corn about 1
to 2 inches thick. The upper end is tightly bound
with string or wire so that about 5 inches of straw
protrude. These whisks are used in producing
marble-edges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BRISTLE BRUSH.</h3>

<p>A bristle brush 3 inches long and from 2 to
2-1/2 inches thick is bound by a well waxed
packing-thread about 1-1/4 inches from the top so
that the bristles are open for a length of 1-3/4
inches. This brush is very well adapted for
distributing the drops.</p>

<p>In marbling large lots of books, large broom-corn
whisks are profitably used for throwing on
the body color or sprinkling water. Being
possessed of the above mentioned utensils which
only are expensive at first, nothing is further
necessary for the production of beautiful edges.</p>


<h3>THE BOOK CLAMP.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i166.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="THE BOOK CLAMP." />
</div>

<p>The clamp is used to hold several books together
which are to be immersed at the same time into
the marbling trough. They are of iron entirely,
are eccentrical in their movement and make a very
quick handling and an easier holding of the books
possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPARATUS FOR THROWING ON COLORS.</h3>

<p>For the purpose of producing nonpareil marble
an equal distribution of color is desirable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i167.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="APPARATUS FOR THROWING ON COLORS." />
</div>

<p>It consists of four small color receptacles and
apparatus from which protrude needles equi-distant
from each other in the form of a rake.</p>

<p>The throwing of marble-colors at equal distances
and in equally large drops on the size is made
possible by it in a very certain and easy way and
is even a good help to the inexperienced
marbler in the production of even and exemplary
edges. For the production of comb-marble on a
large scale this apparatus is especially profitable
as by using it much time is saved.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="STARCHED_EDGES" id="STARCHED_EDGES"></a>STARCHED EDGES.</h2>


<p>A great similarity to marble edges have the so
called starched edges.</p>

<p>To produce this kind of an edge no especial practice
and no important preparations are necessary,
but it permits of many varieties.</p>

<p>For this purpose, books already cut are placed
into the hand press, and in such a way, that the
edge is horizontal.</p>

<p>Dissolve a small quantity of pure rice starch in
water until it has the consistency of a paste, add
the different colors, which must be soluble in water
in order to color properly, such as carmine or
vermilion, cinnabar, Turkey, burnt umber, Prussian-blue,
ultramarine, etc.</p>

<p>When the color added has been carefully united
by stirring with the solution of starch, throw, by
the aid of a small whisk, the solution so colored in
drops that are not too small on the edge placed
horizontally, so that the edge is covered as
uniformly as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as the starch thrown on is dried,
sprinkle on by the aid of a sprinkling brush and
sieve, a darker color over the whole surface and
allow the whole edge to dry again, then brush off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the superfluous starch, and the colored and spotted
edge will appear with veins interspersed.</p>

<p>The edge will be more effective and more
similar to marble, if, for example, bluish-gray
colored starch and then other starch mixed with
red, the former in small the latter in larger drops,
are thrown on so that the edge is quite well covered.
Finally, a dark-brown color is sprinkled over the
whole surface.</p>

<p>Such edges have the effect of bluish-gray
marbling imitations which are interspersed by
dark veins. If you sprinkle on fluid gold bronze
i. e. bronze finely ground in gum-arabic, instead of
the dark-brown color, you obtain the celebrated
gold veined edge in connection with the starched
edge.</p>

<p>Unsized paper is the best for producing starch
edges because it quickly absorbs the moisture of
the starch and color.</p>

<p>To sized paper the color does not stick so readily
and for that reason often runs together. To
prevent this, moisten the edge before applying the
starch color, with some ox-gall, and allow the first
color to dry thoroughly before applying the second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PRODUCTION_OF_COLORED_EDGES" id="THE_PRODUCTION_OF_COLORED_EDGES"></a>THE PRODUCTION OF COLORED EDGES.</h2>


<p>The beautiful marbled edges have nearly
driven every other kind of edges entirely out of
the market.</p>

<p>Aside from marbled edges, colored edges are
mostly used. They will keep their place on
account of the simplicity of their production and
their bright coloring effects.</p>

<p>Red-edges, especially when prettily made, give a
dignified aspect to a book, so to speak, and they
are therefore frequently and properly employed.</p>

<p>Our highly developed color industry offers to us
a very great number of red colors, especially the
carmine, vermilions and cinnabars, all of great
value in our trade. These colors will not fade, the
former carmine possesses great intensity, and
cinnabar has the power to obliterate colors underlying
it.</p>

<p>When cheap colored edges are to be produced
even aniline colors can be taken into consideration.
For instance, eosine is a red color, which used by
itself or in combination with carmine and other
red colors makes a beautiful color for edges but it
will fade on exposure to the sun.</p>

<p>The preparation of these colors is of importance.
Genuine carmine should, after the different pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
have been crushed, be ground for a short time
with a little spirits of ammonia and then allowed
to stand until completely dissolved. To dilute it, a
thin solution of gum or water (the best is rain
water) may be used. If too much spirits of
ammonia has been employed the color will assume
a bluish hue.</p>

<p>The heavy cinnabar makes a more powerful binding
medium necessary, the best being a paste of starch
or a solution of gum-arabic. Careful crushing
and a thorough grinding of the color are essential.</p>

<p>Genuine carmine has a red color with a slight bluish
cast whereas cinnabar approaches yellowish-red.
A pleasing, pure red can be produced by using
Turkish red. A bright lustrous shade is obtained
by adding some red aniline color.</p>

<p>If edges have to be colored blue, use ultramarine
blue for dark, or cobalt blue for light.</p>

<p>Both colors must be mixed with gum-arabic
or paste by grinding, and, if necessary, be diluted
with water.</p>

<p>To produce yellow edges, chrome yellow is
mostly used. It is for sale in all different shades
from the brightest greenish-yellow, to the darkest
orange-yellow.</p>

<p>In using it, like any other mineral or earth
colors, it is finely ground and mixed, for use, with
paste.</p>

<p>Green edges are often produced by using
Schweinfurt's green or silk-green. By mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
light chrome-yellow with cobalt-blue, a beautiful
rich green results.</p>

<p>For brown and black the well known colors
umber, sepia, vegetable lamp-black, drop ivory-black
and others are employed.</p>

<p>The color for producing violet edges can be best
obtained by mixing cobalt-blue with Turkish-red
or carmine.</p>

<p>It is always the most essential part of the
process to grind the color uniformly with the
paste, if it is desirable to obtain an edge of the
same intensity of color.</p>

<p>A peeling off of the color while the edges are
being burnished is due to a lack of paste, or of a
too great consistency or too insufficient fineness of
the color.</p>

<p>Recently our industry has taken this article in
hand and furnishes a large number of beautiful,
cheap and well prepared colors for producing edges
which can be bought more profitably than they
can be laboriously made.</p>

<p>As all colored edges, to give a beautiful effect,
must be burnished after coloring, it is advisable to
execute the coloring while the books are in the
press, place the books after their front edges have
been cut, by the aid of gilding boards into the
hand-press and with a soft brush apply the color
thinly. If the color does not thoroughly cover on
one application, the operation must be repeated
after the first coat has completely dried. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
uniform color is obtained allow the edge to dry in
the press and then burnish it well with a broad
burnisher.</p>

<p>By using a little wax you will render the
burnishing more successful.</p>

<p>The color will sometimes enter into unsized
or wood paper notwithstanding heavy pressure.</p>

<p>To avoid this the edges must be moistened with
a thin paste to which some alum is added. It is
still better to use the grounding substance manufactured
by William Leo, of Stuttgart.</p>

<p>If beautiful edges are to be produced, then, in
cutting the book it is necessary to see that the
knife of the machine is free from nicks, so that
the cut is clean and smooth.</p>

<p>At the fore-edge of the book there will always
appear some small parts of the different sheets
protruding slightly. If this is to be overcome,
these edges are to be treated as hollow edges which
means that they must be scraped hollow before
coloring and must be burnished with the round-burnisher.</p>

<p>The use of colored edges is always left to
individual taste. The following rule may be of
some advantage; colored edges must have a
binding of an opposite color. A red edge will
appear to most advantage with a white, gray, dull-green,
dark-brown or antique binding.</p>

<p>Bindings of a reddish-brown color would lose in
their general aspect by the employment of a red
edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>If books with red edges are to be covered
with red, it is then essential that the colors of both
are corresponding.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chpg" title="">GILT EDGES.</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>


<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="GILT_EDGES" id="GILT_EDGES"></a>GILT EDGES.</h2>


<p>In the production of gilt edges, there have not
been any essential improvements noticed.</p>

<p>If the gilt-edge is to-day produced more beautifully
and perfectly than formerly, it is due in part
to a more extensive experience and practice, and
also to the excellent quality of gold-leaf now on
the market.</p>

<p>No edges contribute so greatly to the generally
elegant appearance of a book as gilt-edges; they
are lustrous and rich and are more pleasing to the
eyes of most men than the plain and unseemly
colored edges, though a great deal of trouble and
industry is necessary to the production of these
beautiful effects.</p>

<p>A principal condition in the production of gilt-edges
is the utmost cleanliness and skill in
executing the necessary manipulations.</p>

<p>In cutting the book, great care must be taken
that the cuts are entirely smooth and clean,
without any blemish. Sharp knifes are therefore
indispensable in this kind of work.</p>

<p>Gilt-edges demand an entirely smooth surface
which is only produced by carefully scraping the
surface with a steel scraper. The edge must be
scraped perfectly smooth so as not to show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
marks of the knife in cutting or those of the
scraper. To this end the books, the edges of which
have already been cut, are placed between
gilding-boards in hand presses in such a way that
the fore-edge protrudes but slightly over the cheeks
of the press. After the press has been tightly
drawn down and has been fastened firmly, the
scraping of the edges can be begun. When this
tiresome work has been finished, and an entirely
smooth surface has been obtained, the surface is
moistened with a paste-water and rubbed dry with
clean paper-shavings. By this grinding and
rubbing off, the edge becomes shiny and dry, and
gains in the power of resistance, which is of great
importance for the burnishing that occurs in the
later stage of gilt-edging.</p>

<p>The smooth, hard ground of paste is not
sufficient for the production of gilt-edges that are
perfectly beautiful.</p>

<p>They must be colored lightly with bolus or
chalk, (the most adapted to this work is the finely
washed Armenian bole.)</p>

<p>The book-binders supply establishment of Wm.
Leo, of Stuttgart, provides an excellent article.</p>

<p>This bole after it has been finely ground and
scraped, must be mixed with a solution of albumen
(the white of the egg) such as is used for laying
on gold leaf, and must be spread lightly and
evenly over the edge by a fine broad hair brush or
with a fine sponge, to prohibit the scaling off of the
gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>This process must be repeated. The ground of
bole gives the gilt-edge a dark shade and a high
lustre and glow.</p>

<p>When the grounding of bole is entirely dry, and
all the parts clinging to the edge have been carefully
brushed off, we begin the most difficult part
in the production of gilt-edges, the laying on of
the gold.</p>

<p>As binding medium between the gold-leaf and
the edge of the book, a solution of the white of the
egg is used. Carefully separate the white of the
egg from the yolk and dilute the same with 1 pint
of water and stir until a perfect mixture of the two
results. After this fluid has stood for several
hours, it becomes perfectly clear, the froth of the
egg floating upon the surface is removed and the
solution is ready for use.</p>

<p>Paper containing lime makes a stronger size
necessary.</p>

<p>To transfer the gold-leaf, which has been cut on
the gold cushion to the size required, on to the
edge, a rectangular light wooden frame of wood or
paste board is used, across which two horse hairs
or silk threads are stretched parallel to the long
sides of the rectangle in such a way that they can
be moved at will nearer to or farther from one
another.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Much more practical than this frame is the
laying-on apparatus. It can be more easily and
securely handled, and the laying on strings can be
more easily set.</p>

<p>By means of this simple instrument the sheets
of gold-leaf which are laying ready on the cushion
and which must be so wide that they not only
cover the edge entirely but also protrude about 1/8
inch beyond the gilding boards are transferred on
to the sized edge. The sizing must be done with
a soft camels hair brush, not too thin and it is
essential that the gilding boards also become
moistened.</p>

<p>The strings of this laying on apparatus or of the
frame must be so far distant from each other that
they reach from gilding board to gilding board.</p>

<p>The sheets of gold leaf that have been cut before
must then be carefully transferred, one by one, on
the sized edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the gold-leaf adhere to the strings of
the frame, the strings are rubbed slightly upon the
hair of the head by which means they absorb
sufficient fatty substance to hold the light sheets
of gold.</p>

<p>If after the gold is laid on it should contain any
imperfections or breaks, other portions must be
applied to these abrasions. The press is then
placed aside until the edge is entirely dry. In
treating the upper and lower edges i. e. after the
book has been rounded, care must always be taken
that in sizing, not too much moisture impregnates
the back part of the edges as there is no pressure
to prevent the size from running in.</p>

<p>If the gilt-edge is to have lustre and glow by
burnishing, great care must be taken to dry the
edge well.</p>

<p>An edge, which is not sufficiently dried, will
exhibit breaks in the gold on burnishing, and an
edge which is too dry will never have the desired
lustre.</p>

<p>It is impossible to name the time within which
gilt-edges become dry. This depends upon the
temperature of the room, the quality of the paper
in the book and on the quantity of albumen
solution which has been put on the edge.</p>

<p>The safest way to find out whether the edge is
dry or not is to blow upon it. If the lustre of the
gold is dimmed for several seconds, the edge is
still too moist, but if the cloud vanishes immediately
the edge is sufficiently dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>We can also determine by a careful easy
burnishing whether the edge is dry enough to be
worked further.</p>

<p>The burnishing should always be executed with
a flat agate burnisher, and afterwards followed by
a flat blood stone. The burnishing should be
commenced by covering the edge with a piece of
thin smooth paper that has been rubbed with wax.</p>

<p>First burnish the gold laid on slightly, afterwards
continue with greater force.</p>

<p>By this the edge acquires a uniformly dull
aspect but a strong union of gold and paper is
thereby established.</p>

<p>Before beginning the real burnishing rub the
edge with a soft rag upon which a small quantity
of pure white wax has been rubbed. This thin
film of wax renders the burnishing much easier
because the burnisher is made to glide more
readily and securely over the edge.</p>

<p>The burnishing must first be executed lightly
and then with greater force.</p>

<p>The repairing of gilt-edges should be avoided as
much as possible. Should it become, nevertheless,
unavoidable, then moisten the spots to be repaired
with the solution of albumen described above, lay
on gold leaf, allow the spots which you wish to
repair to become dry, rub off and burnish as usual.</p>

<p>In place of albumen solution, sulphuric ether
can be used for repairing. The latter has the
advantage of causing the spots so repaired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
become dry immediately, but it causes a lighter
spot to appear in the gilt-edge. Alcohol, lightly
applied, can also be used for this purpose and with
more security. The gilding of the hollow edge is
produced in the same way as that of the level
edge. In scraping, curved scrapers are used. To
lay on the gold use the frame. Transfer the gold
leaf from the gold cushion to the strings of the
frame, then carefully bring these strings closer to
each other, so that the gold leaf is no longer
straight, but somewhat hanging down. Then
transfer it to the sized edge.</p>

<p>To burnish give the hand press an oblique
position, making the front of the press lay lower
than the rear so that one half of the hollow edge has a
more horizontal position, and burnish it with a flat
burnisher in the same manner as the level edge.
This being done, the remainder of the hollow edge
is likewise treated at the same time, giving the
press a different position. Only after the edge has
been burnished on both sides with a flat burnisher,
is the round burnisher (tooth) used to finish the
hollow edge on its length.</p>

<p>Gilding on a colored, especially a red edge is
very effective. These gilt-edges with an underlying
red-edge are of English origin and are used
generally for Bibles and prayer books. The fore
edge of such books is colored in an oblique position
of the edge, and they therefore have not a golden,
but a red effect, when opened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The production of such edges demands a certain
experience, if the coloring of the fore-edge shall
have a correct effect, and the leaves of the book
are to be as little as possible impregnated by the
color.</p>

<p>This color must be mixed like any other edge
colors with gum-arabic, starch paste or the white
of an egg.</p>

<p>All etching substances, such as spirits of
ammonia, must be avoided as they often cause the
color to soak too deeply into the paper.</p>

<p>In manipulating the fore edge, open the book
slightly, fasten the edge in this oblique position
and then lightly apply the color.</p>

<p>When this has thoroughly dried, open the edge
towards the other side and continue with the same
procedure.</p>

<p>The different leaves are thus not only colored at
the edges proper, but the color has also been
slightly imparted to the upper and lower sides of
the leaves at the same time, and for this reason
the edge of the book, after it is gilded, appears
reddish when the book is opened out.</p>

<p>The upper and lower edges must be treated as
all other colored edges.</p>

<p>In producing the gilt-edge in the way above
mentioned, rubbing off with paste and grounding
with bole must of course not be employed.</p>

<p>The production of edges with metal leaf
or aluminium, is under the same rules as for gilt
edges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>To produce silver edges, a sizing material of a
solution of gelatine (one half of a gelatine cake to
one cup of water) is used as a surrogate to the
albumen. This can also be employed in the
laying on of aluminium.</p>

<p>For base metal leaf care should be taken that a
soft, thin article is used, the one of a light
hue is more pliable on account of the larger
quantity of tin contained in it than is in the
darker copper one.</p>

<p>The more pliable French aluminium is preferable
to the brittle German article.</p>

<p>If gilt-edges are to be produced upon unsized
paper, the edges must be sized with a solution of
gelatine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of edges gilt front and back with
marbling between is beautiful. This edge is especially
applicable to books of large size.</p>

<p>The plain red-edge (carmine) and every marbled

<p>Antique marbles are greatly adapted to this

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i219.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="COLORED EDGES WITH FRONT AND END GILDING." />
</div>

<p>The production of these edges does not offer any
especial technical difficulties. The book block
must be treated as a hollow edge and must be
scraped and then decorated with antique marbling
or red color.</p>

<p>This having been done, insert the book into the
hand-press and mark correctly how far the gilding
is to be done.</p>

<p>To put on the gold, a solution of albumen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
applied to the spots to be gilded and then a good
and substantial gold leaf is laid on. As soon as
the edge is dry, burnish as any other gilt-edge.</p>

<p>A fine chased pearl line at the meeting of the
two edges, will greatly enhance the effect of this
beautiful edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PUNCHED_OR_CHASED" id="THE_PUNCHED_OR_CHASED"></a>THE PUNCHED OR CHASED<br />GILT-EDGE.</h2>


<p>The procedure by which the effect of the gilt-edge
is enhanced and enlivened by chasing is very
old, in fact nearly as old as the gilt-edge itself.
It has been driven out of the market as many
another thing by over production and has finally
become obsolete. In recent times it has been taken
up again on account of the progress in the industrial
arts and is now very highly esteemed. The design
for such a decoration of gilt-edges should always
be prepared by an artist and should always conform
strictly to the decorations of the cover.</p>

<p>Technically, the production of such edges is
not difficult. Some talent for drawing and a sure
hand are necessary, but the artist is repaid for his
labor by the interest he derives from the execution
of such kind of work.</p>

<p>There are two ways of producing them.</p>

<p>The first makes the ornament appear bright,
while the ground remains dull, in the other the
dull ornament appears on the shining ground
surface.</p>

<p>The first is the more effective and the more
easily produced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The gilt-edge is here to be treated like every
other plain gilt-edge, to produce dull ground,
burnish with a piece of paper between the book
edge and the burnisher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Transfer the design on thin tissue paper, lay
the paper carefully upon the edge of the book
placed in the press so that design and edge
tally perfectly, and fasten the paper by pasting it
on the gilding boards.</p>

<p>If you now by the aid of a dull awl or a
pin trace the design of the tissue paper on the
edge, it will appear and will be the gilder's guide.
When this has been done with all necessary care,
remove the paper and burnish the parts of the edge
between the tracings by means of a small, pointed
burnisher.</p>

<p>This alone relieves the ornament from the dull
gilt ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The full effect of such edges will be imparted
when the outlines of the ornaments are pressed in.
To do this, fine steel stencils or stamps are best used,
the same as are used for fine leather work. These
stamps and the above mentioned agate burnishers
can be obtained from Wm. Leo, Stuttgart.</p>

<p>Take the point stamp in one hand and a
light hammer in the other and with an easy, equal,
hammering make dot after dot of the marked
pattern. If the dull ground is then profusely
marked with the small pearl stamp as shown in
the illustration, the effect of such edges leaves
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>The effect is still more surprising when the
ornaments are produced in gold of a different hue
or of silver or color. In the former case the
ornaments are carefully penciled in with albumen
solution, gold of a lighter hue, silver or aluminium
is put on, and, when completely dried, is burnished.</p>

<p>Colored ornaments are likewise scraped out and
then produced by painting.</p>

<p>It is a question though, whether the total effect
of this last named is a refined one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<hr class="c65" />
<h2><a name="THE_BRONZED_EDGE" id="THE_BRONZED_EDGE"></a>THE BRONZED EDGE.</h2>


<p>Produced by printing over colored edges. It is
certainly proper to endeavor to brighten colored
edges by spreading on bronzed color.</p>

<p>That this process has fallen more or less into
disuse is probably due to the tiresome labor
necessary for the making of such edges. It gives
us the possibility of producing manifold changes
in edges because silver or gold ornaments can be
put on any color as well as on the white edge.</p>

<p>We have here the possibility of adapting the
design of the edge to that of the cover, which under
other conditions can only be done with chased edges.</p>

<p>It is an erroneous idea to disfigure genuine gilt-edge
by putting on bronze ornaments. The base
and perishable bronze can never be the correct
material to brighten the effect of genuine gold.</p>

<p>The bronzing of edges can only be applied to
colored or white edges but not to genuine gilt-edges.</p>

<p>For the production of bronzed edges, the following
articles are necessary.</p>

<p>First, Engraved plate or Cliche representing the
ornament with which the edge is to be decorated.</p>

<p>Second, Thin leaves of roller composition for the
transfer of the ornament from the plate on to the
edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Third, Roller for rolling in the gravure.</p>

<p>Fourth, Thick, fluid, strong amber-lacquer, as
binding medium between the bronze and the color
of the edge.</p>

<p>The following rules should be observed.</p>

<p>The treatment of the book block is similar to that
of the hollow edge, therefore the book, after the
fore edge has been cut and rounded must be
scraped hollow.</p>

<p>As colors for the edge, the above mentioned
colors, carmine, cinnabar, cobalt-blue and others are
recommendable.</p>

<p>As binding medium a strong albumen or gum-arabic
should be used. Aniline colors can be used
for this purpose, but they must be dissolved in
alcohol.</p>

<p>Such edges have a bewitching appearance if
they are made in the same shade of color as the
cover, but they render a certain practice in the
mixture of colors necessary.</p>

<p>The coloring and burnishing of the edges is
executed in the same manner as described in the
article upon the production of colored edges.
After the burnishing of the edge is executed, the
time has arrived to imprint the ornament upon it.</p>

<p>Cut off of the thin leaf of roller composition, a strip
slightly larger than the surface of the edge. Put a little
of the thick, fluid amber-lacquer upon the roller,
and move the roller forward and back on a smooth
stone (marble slab) until the lacquer is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
spread out over the surface of the roller. When
this is done, the gravure can be rolled over by
aid of this roller.</p>

<p>The thin strip of roller composition is then carefully
placed on the gravure, pressed on lightly and
evenly with cotton wadding or a soft rag. By this
means the ornament of the gravure is transferred
to the roller composition.</p>

<p>To transfer this ornament on to the surface of
the edge, it is necessary to lay the strip of roller
composition carefully on the edge and carefully
and evenly press it on.</p>

<p>The bronze is not to be put on to the edge on
which the design is printed before the lacquer is
quite dry, only then can the blurring of the
ornament be avoided and the bronze be made to
retain its specific metallic lustre.</p>

<p>After the lapse of several hours, the bronze will
be dry, and then the cleaning of the edge is done
with soft cotton wadding.</p>

<p>The strips of roller composition so used must be
cleaned immediately after use with clean turpentine
and, after they are dried, they can be again used.</p>

<p>In order to produce the necessary transfer strips
use only the best English roller composition.
Cut this mass into small pieces, place them in an
earthen vessel, subject them to a moderate heat
until they become entirely fluid and pour the fluid
mass on a piece of glass or a smooth sheet of tin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
After this has cooled it should be carefully removed.
To render this easier, the plate of glass or the
piece of tin should be lubricated with some fine oil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>If gilt, silver or aluminium edges are to be
marbled, they must be thoroughly dried, burnished
slightly and rubbed off with a small piece of
linen, silk or leather, and any blemishes or spots
from which the gold or other metal has blistered
must be repaired.</p>

<p>The dull gilt-edge is now to be moistened by
means of a soft brush with a solution of powdered
alum in hot water after this has formed a thin
paste.</p>

<p>The marbling of the gilt-edge is executed in the
usual way, before the layer of alum is entirely
dried. After the completion of the marbling the
edge must be washed with water until it is entirely
clean.</p>

<p>After the edge has become dry, it is rubbed with
a waxed rag and burnished over.</p>

<p>For marbling, the common marbling colors can
be used.</p>

<p>It remains only to add that too dry edges do not
take marbling colors readily.<span class="pagenum hidp"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
